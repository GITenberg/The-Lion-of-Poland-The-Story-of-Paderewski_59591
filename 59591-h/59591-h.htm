<h3><i>AUTHORS&rsquo; NOTE</i></h3>
<p>Our warmest thanks must go to all those through
whose kindness the material for this book was assembled.
We are particularly indebted to Mrs. Robert
Woods Bliss and to the Honorable Harry S Truman
for their generosity of time and spirit in giving
us invaluable personal recollections of Paderewski.</p>
<p>The following publishers kindly allowed us the use
of copyrighted material: Charles Scribner&rsquo;s Sons,
facts and quotations from <span class="smaller">THE PADEREWSKI MEMOIRS</span>,
by Ignace Jan Paderewski and Mary Lawton; Rutgers
University Press, a quotation from <span class="smaller">PADEREWSKI AS I
KNEW HIM</span>, by Aniela Strakacz; The Macmillan Company,
for facts from <span class="smaller">PADEREWSKI, THE STORY OF A
MODERN IMMORTAL</span>, by Charles Phillips; <i>Harper&rsquo;s
Magazine</i>, for a quotation from &ldquo;Paderewski, the Paradox
of Europe,&rdquo; by Colonel Edward M. House; the
<i>New York Times Magazine</i>, for a quotation from
&ldquo;The Paderewski Saga,&rdquo; by Charlotte Kellogg (Mrs.
Kellogg is also the author of <span class="smaller">PADEREWSKI</span>, an excellent
biography for young people that would be of special
interest to any readers who wish to investigate the
subject further); Simon and Schuster, Inc., for the
quotation from <span class="smaller">MEN, WOMEN, AND PIANOS</span>, copyright
1954 by Arthur Loesser; Julian Messner, Inc., for
the story of Paderewski&rsquo;s meeting with Clemenceau
in 1922 told in <span class="smaller">THE WORLD OF CARNEGIE HALL</span>, by
Richard Schickel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>In an effort to give a complete and accurate picture
of Paderewski we investigated every available
book and magazine article about him that we could
get hold of. The fact that so many <i>were</i> available is
entirely due to the good offices of the Music Division
of the Library of Congress to which we are continually
grateful on this and other scores.</p>

<h3>A Note About Pronunciation</h3>
<p>Although Paderewski quickly grew accustomed
to hearing himself called &ldquo;Paderooski&rdquo; all across
America, this is not his name! A Polish &ldquo;w&rdquo; is
pronounced like an English &ldquo;v&rdquo;, so he is really
&ldquo;Pa-de-<i>rev</i>-skee.&rdquo; Since Polish surnames change
their final &ldquo;i&rdquo; to &ldquo;a&rdquo; when applied to women, his
wife is called Madame &ldquo;Pa-de-<i>rev</i>-ska.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy lay awake in the darkness, listening.</p>
<p>All evening long the adults in the house had been
conversing in agitated whispers, behind closed doors.
Now they were asleep&mdash;or pretending to be asleep, as
he was pretending. The house was unnaturally silent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Suddenly the boy sat up in bed, clutching the blanket
around his shoulders and listening with every
ounce of concentration he could muster. His ears
were unusually sensitive. Surely he had heard a muted
laugh in the blackness outside. Yes&mdash;and there was another,
and then the sound of low-pitched voices, no
longer concealed, and finally footsteps running to the
house.</p>
<p>He leaped out of bed and flung open the window.
The house was surrounded by Cossacks. Their leader
was pounding on the door. &ldquo;Jan Paderewski!&rdquo; he was
shouting. &ldquo;Open it up before we break it down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy could hear the heavy bolt being drawn. By
the time he had crept fearfully downstairs it was all
over. His father was gone. His sister and his aunt were
sobbing in each other&rsquo;s arms. He ran into the courtyard.
&ldquo;Where is my father? What have you done
with him?&rdquo; he asked one of the soldiers. When the
man ignored him, he tugged at his coat and cried,
&ldquo;Where are you taking my father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A stinging pain shot along his cheek as the Russian
whirled and struck at him with a knout. &ldquo;Let go of my
coat, you Polish brat!&rdquo; the man half snarled and half
laughed. He called out some orders to his men, and the
troop clattered down the road and out of the boy&rsquo;s
sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The boy raised his hand to his smarting cheek. The
Cossack rope had ripped across it like a firebrand, and
the fire had burned itself into his soul.</p>
<p>Young Ignace Paderewski was only four years old
on the night the Russian soldiers took his father to
prison for a year. Jan Paderewski had been accused
of plotting the overthrow of his Imperial Majesty,
Alexander II, Emperor of all the Russias.</p>
<p>What Jan Paderewski had actually done was to
allow firearms to be stored in his basement until such
time as they might be useful. But besides getting him
arrested and imprisoned, they had actually accomplished
very little. The revolution of 1863 and 1864
was just one more in a succession of uprisings by
which the Polish people struck back at their oppressors.
None of these unhappy revolts had ever won
back the country&rsquo;s lost freedom, but they kept alive
the fierce pride of the Polish people, a pride that the
rulers of three nations had tried for nearly a hundred
years to extinguish.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Poland, as a nation, no longer existed. The ancient
Catholic kingdom had been swallowed up by three
hungry neighbors: Germany, Austria, and Russia. It
had not, therefore, been swallowed whole, but in
pieces. Three times&mdash;in 1772, in 1793, in 1795&mdash;the
three royal butchers had met over a map of Poland
and thought up new ways of dividing the country to
their mutual satisfaction. To their distaste they found
the Polish people did not agree with their selfish plans.</p>
<p>Ignace Jan Paderewski was born in the Russian
third of Poland, on November 6, 1860. His mother
died when he was a baby, so his father&rsquo;s imprisonment
was a doubly cruel blow. The boy and his older sister,
Antonina, were very close. Like all Polish children,
they had been brought up on heroic tales of their
country&rsquo;s former glory, and their childhood games
always centered around the melancholy struggle for
freedom. The boy, dressed in a Polish uniform of red
and white paper, would charge madly about the house
on a hobby horse, smiting his country&rsquo;s enemies with
a wooden sword. By the time he was six or seven these
games had taken on a reality for him that no one suspected.
Young as he was, he determined that when he
grew up he would fight for his country, not with a
wooden sword but with whatever weapons God
would give him. Gradually he took it into his head
that only by becoming someone special could he ever
hope to help his people and his country to freedom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Soon after Jan Paderewski&rsquo;s release from prison, he
moved his family to the little town of Sudylkow,
where the boy grew up. By the time he was three,
Ignace&rsquo;s family realized that he had an unusual talent
for music. His father, determined to give every possible
advantage to his children, brought a music
teacher to the house to give them piano lessons. The
teacher was a violinist at heart and he could not do
much for the children except teach them the names
of the notes and set them to playing dreadful duets,
arranged from popular operatic arias.</p>
<p>As a student Ignace was rather lazy, but he had a
natural gift for languages and a great love for reading
the history of his country. When he was ten years old,
his sympathetic tutor gave him a book that described
the great battle of Gr&uuml;nwald in which the Poles had
defeated the greedy German Knights of the Cross
and driven them from Poland. As the boy read the
stirring account over and over, he was struck by an
inspiration. The battle had been fought in 1410. This
meant that its five hundredth anniversary was only
forty years away&mdash;in 1910. &ldquo;When I grow up,&rdquo;
young Ignace promised himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be
rich and famous enough to build a great monument
in honor of the anniversary of the battle of Gr&uuml;nwald!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>It was one of those odd fancies that overtake sensitive
children. He kept it to himself to avoid unnecessary
laughter at his expense.</p>
<p>It seemed obvious to Ignace&rsquo;s father that his son was
clearly headed for a career in music. The boy played
the piano constantly, although he much preferred to
improvise his own melodies rather than practice anyone
else&rsquo;s. The music notebook that his proud father
had given him was already half filled with random
compositions. But how, Jan Paderewski wondered,
could the poor boy possibly get the musical training
he needed in Sudylkow? When word came to town
that a railroad was soon to be built, connecting
Sudylkow with Warsaw, the father took it as a sign
from heaven. In Warsaw there was a famous conservatory
of music. Jan Paderewski swore that his boy
would have a chance to study there, no matter how
much penny-pinching would have to be done at home
in order to finance the venture. In 1872, when Ignace
was twelve years old, he and his father set out on the
very first train that ran to Warsaw.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="700" />
<p class="caption"><i>Ignace and Antonina were very close.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>It was an exciting and a somewhat frightening adventure.
The Warsaw Conservatory did not have
dormitories and supervised living for its students, as
a modern school would have. The twelve-year-old
country boy would be more or less on his own in the
big city. Added to this worry was Mr. Paderewski&rsquo;s
concern over the fact that his son had had so little
formal training in music. Would the entrance exams
at the Conservatory be too much for him? As they
were ushered into the office of Director Kontski, the
father was more unnerved than the boy.</p>
<p>The director looked at Ignace&rsquo;s musical composition
book and then he looked squarely at Ignace.
The boy returned his gaze without a blink. Kontski
turned to the anxious father and said cordially, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
take this boy immediately&mdash;and without any examinations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first hurdle had been taken easily.</p>
<p>Their unexpected luck at the Conservatory had
improved Mr. Paderewski&rsquo;s spirits. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said
to Ignace, &ldquo;all our worries are over! First we buy
you a piano! Then we find you a place to live!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>A few hours later his optimism was again on the
decline. Although father and son had inspected nearly
every piano in Warsaw, they had seen nothing that
was not far too expensive. The last address on their
list was that of the Kerntopf factory, the most famous
piano manufacturers in Poland.</p>
<p>A wasted effort, this one, the elder Paderewski
thought gloomily, as he trudged up the stairs to the
showroom. If he had not been able to meet the price
of lesser piano makers, how could he afford a Kerntopf
piano?</p>
<p>Mr. Kerntopf himself greeted the two weary customers.
Yes, he told the father, several used pianos
were available but they were rather expensive. At the
price Mr. Paderewski had mentioned? Well, there
was only the old upright over in the corner. The boy
was welcome to try it out if he cared to.</p>
<p>Ignace rushed over to the piano and began to play.
It wasn&rsquo;t much of a piano, perhaps, but as long as he
had something&mdash;anything&mdash;to practice on, he would
be happy.</p>
<p>While he was playing, a younger man came into
the showroom and stood listening attentively. After a
while he turned to Mr. Paderewski and said, &ldquo;What
plans have you in mind for your son?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>The father said proudly, &ldquo;My boy has just been
accepted for the Conservatory without an examination.
That&rsquo;s why I want to buy him a piano!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not this old thing!&rdquo; the young man said. &ldquo;It
would be worthless in a year. You don&rsquo;t have to buy
him a piano! I will give him one to practice on. For
nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Paderewski could hardly believe his ears. He
looked inquiringly at Mr. Kerntopf. &ldquo;This is my partner
and my eldest son,&rdquo; the old gentleman said, shrugging
as if to say that there was nothing he could do
about this sort of impulse. But he looked pleased in
spite of himself.</p>
<p>Mr. Paderewski said, &ldquo;Now I must find a place for
Ignace to live. I would like to get him a room with a
family. He is so young to be alone in the city. Perhaps
you could advise me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward Kerntopf laughed. &ldquo;<i>Here</i> is a family. It&rsquo;s
a little big already. There are ten children in it, so one
more will hardly be noticed! Leave your boy here and
he can practice on all the pianos in the factory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Paderewski beamed. All his problems had been
solved at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>God works in different ways to help the people
who are close to Him accomplish His work and theirs.
In Paderewski&rsquo;s life it happened time and again that
when exactly the right person was needed to fill a
specific need, that person was always sent to him.
Edward Kerntopf was the first of many.</p>
<p>Although young Ignace wept bitterly when it was
time to say goodbye to his father, his tears dried
quickly. A houseful of youngsters to play with, and
a factory full of pianos to play on! It was a splendid
combination.</p>
<p>On the day Ignace reported to the Conservatory for
his first piano lesson, his excitement was so great that
he could hardly walk without reeling. Never in his
short life had he looked forward to anything so eagerly.
To study piano with a really fine teacher!
Young as he was, the boy knew very well that although
he could improvise cleverly and could impress
his neighbors in Sudylkow, he did not really know
how to play the piano correctly. He had a vast natural
instinct for music, but such matters as correct hand
position, fingering, and proper pedalling were mysteries
to him. This was not surprising, since neither of
his teachers at home had known much more than he
himself knew about piano technique. But now, he
thought naively, now at last he would learn everything!
Here at the Conservatory some great teacher
would give him the key to unlock all the secrets of the
piano.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>By the end of the first lesson, poor Ignace&rsquo;s enthusiasm
had been cruelly dampened. The teacher to
whom he had been assigned was a surly type. He
listened to the boy play for a few minutes and then
said flatly, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never be a pianist. You haven&rsquo;t got
the hands for it!&rdquo; He added helpfully, &ldquo;I understand
you write music. You&rsquo;d better stick to that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a blow, but Ignace realized that one man was
not the whole faculty. Immediately after the lesson,
he went to Director Kontski and asked for another
teacher. Unfortunately, the second teacher was exactly
the opposite of the first. The first man cared
only for ready-made technique and had failed to recognize
the boy&rsquo;s natural talent. The second man, with
whom Ignace studied for two years, was so poetic and
romantic in his approach to music that he paid no
attention to the hardcore technical problems of piano
playing. Although he had vast admiration for his
young pupil, he could not give him what he most
needed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>After several discouraging weeks at the Conservatory,
Ignace was ready to agree that he was not really
cut out to be a pianist. Perhaps he should start thinking
seriously about some other instrument. Since he
had always liked the sound of the flute, he decided to
try it out. The flute teacher decided otherwise.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never be a flute player, boy! You haven&rsquo;t got
the lips for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The teacher of oboe and clarinet was a much more
agreeable man, but he finally had to admit that Ignace&rsquo;s
future did not lie with either instrument. So
did the teacher of bassoon and French horn. In time,
however, the young musician found his instrumental
niche. &ldquo;Now, my dear boy,&rdquo; the professor of brass
instruments told him one day, &ldquo;you are always trying
to play piano. But why? You have no future at all
with the piano! Your future is here, playing the trombone!&rdquo;
He flung an arm enthusiastically around Ignace&rsquo;s
shoulder. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that you are a great
natural trombone player?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="" width="453" height="800" />
<p class="caption"><i>He spent hours at the piano.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>The teachers who were most enthusiastic about the
new student, however, were the men who taught him
theory and harmony and composition. &ldquo;Never mind
which instrument you play best,&rdquo; they told him.
&ldquo;Learn to play all of them because it will be useful to
you as a composer. And it is as a composer that you
will become famous. As a pianist, never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as he sat night after night in the dimly-lit warehouse,
as he worked hour after hour trying to make
his fingers produce the kind of sound he wanted to
lure out of the piano, he knew that nothing had
changed. He would be a pianist no matter who said
what. He would be a pianist if it took him a dozen
more years to find the right teacher!</p>
<p>Hard work and discouragement did not by any
means prevent Ignace from thoroughly enjoying life
in Warsaw. For the first time in his life he had a
chance to hear real music, properly performed. Edward
Kerntopf saw to that. He took the boy to a succession
of concerts and operas, and even took him
visiting in the homes of Warsaw&rsquo;s leading musicians.
Nothing could shake his faith in Ignace&rsquo;s future as a
pianist, even though the boy had so far shown progress
in nothing but trombone playing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>During his first few days in Warsaw, Edward had
taken him to see all the city&rsquo;s beloved monuments to
the past. Ignace returned to them again and again,
dreaming as he had dreamed from his childhood of
the day when his country would be reborn. He liked
to walk by the great yellow Zamek, once the royal
palace of the kings of Poland. In the palace square
stood the noble bronze figure of King Sigismond III,
who held a cross in one hand and a sword in the other.
Like every other Polish boy, Ignace knew the prophecy
that had grown up around the statue: &ldquo;When
Sigismond shakes his sword,&rdquo; the old folks said, &ldquo;then
Poland will be free again!&rdquo; How many times Ignace
went to the square to stare, fascinated, at the statue.
Yet the king held his bronze sword rigid and immobile,
and it seemed unlikely that he would ever be
able to shake it in the name of freedom.</p>
<p>Near the Zamek, in a triangle of fresh green trees,
was the shrine of the Mother of Sorrows. The heroic
King John Sobieski had built it two hundred years
before and dedicated it to &ldquo;the Queen of Poland.&rdquo; It
was here that the boy knelt most often to pray for the
liberation of his country and for his own future. Another
favorite spot was the seventeenth century
Church of the Holy Cross, a spot particularly dear to
the people of Warsaw. In its crypt was buried the
heart of Chopin, and as young Paderewski saw it for
the first time, he must have felt as many Poles had felt
before him that the heart of Poland itself was buried
in this holy spot. &ldquo;Where your treasure is,&rdquo; read the
inscription over the shrine, &ldquo;there shall your heart
be also.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Although Ignace was a serious boy and a tireless
student, he had an incurable streak of mischief in him.
In Warsaw, for the first time, he had a real opportunity
to exercise it. At home, he had never had any
playmates but his older sister, and a boy&rsquo;s older sister
is hardly the ideal playmate. But now the rather shy
country lad blossomed out and became a favorite
among his young fellow students. They called him
&ldquo;Squirrel,&rdquo; in honor of his quick ways and his bright
red hair. (Polish squirrels are not gray, but red.) He
soon became the ringleader in most of the pranks that
went on in the stately corridors of the Conservatory.
He also became an expert in the art of playing practical
jokes on the older, more dignified students,
who frequently called him several names other than
&ldquo;Squirrel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>It was not Ignace&rsquo;s mischief-making, however, that
finally got him into serious trouble with the officials
of the school. It was his skill as a trombone player.
During the boy&rsquo;s second year as a student, Director
Kontski decided to rouse up some publicity for the
Conservatory by founding a student orchestra to play
at local functions. As the school&rsquo;s finest trombone
player, Ignace was naturally drafted into the brass
section as first trombone. Final exams were looming
ahead. The nearer they came, the more the boy resented
the considerable time he had to spend blowing
his trombone at rehearsals when he preferred to be
studying the complexities of harmony and counterpoint.
One day he flatly refused to attend the day&rsquo;s
rehearsal.</p>
<p>The outraged director called him into the office and
delivered a lecture on student discipline. Ignace
countered with some ideas of his own on the useless,
time-wasting aspects of the student orchestra. One
word led to another, as one word unfortunately does
at tense moments. Before he knew exactly what had
happened, Master Ignace Paderewski had been expelled
from the Warsaw Conservatory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Fortunately for Ignace, he had friends among the
faculty members. They raised such a fuss in his behalf
that the Director was forced to change his mind. The
boy was taken back in time to pass his examinations.</p>
<p>A less hot-headed fellow than the red-headed
&ldquo;Squirrel&rdquo; might have learned a lesson from this extremely
close call. But Ignace did not have the sense
to stay out of trouble. The next year the orchestra
question flared again. Seven students drew up a letter
of protest which appeared over their signatures in the
newspaper. The seven students were promptly expelled
for one year, Ignace among them. This time no
amount of influence helped.</p>
<p>Only the loyal support of Edward Kerntopf enabled
Ignace to stay on in Warsaw and work at the
piano as best he could by himself. And by giving
piano lessons to the young children of Kerntopf customers
he earned the princely sum of twelve cents an
hour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>By the end of the school year he was getting a little
bored with this routine and yearned to launch his
concert career. So did his best friend, a seventeen-year-old
violin student who was also named Ignace.
&ldquo;Why wait around until we&rsquo;re too old to enjoy success?&rdquo;
the seventeen-year-old asked the fifteen-year-old.
&ldquo;Now look, Squirrel. We&rsquo;re wasting our time!
The summer vacation is coming. What do people do
in summer? They go to summer resorts. And they
need entertainment there, don&rsquo;t they? Let&rsquo;s go on tour
and present a violin and piano recital. You have
enough Liszt and Chopin pieces ready for your half
of the program. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;uh&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! Then it&rsquo;s all settled. We&rsquo;ll tour as far as
Russia. That&rsquo;s it! We&rsquo;ll go all the way to St. Petersburg,
leaving a trail of triumph behind us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ignace&rsquo;s eyes lit up. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! We&rsquo;ll conquer
Russia. We&rsquo;ll show them what a couple of <i>Polish</i>
musicians can do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the end a cellist joined the troupe, and the foolish
trio of young hopefuls started out in the direction of
the nearest resort hotel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;How different from today,&rdquo; Paderewski said later,
as he reminisced about his boyhood adventures. &ldquo;Such
a thing could probably not happen in these years of
rapid communication, with parents in constant touch
with pampered children. Although still youths, we
were to a great extent &lsquo;on our own,&rsquo; as you put it, and
parental advice was not close at hand. We were completely
out of touch with our families. So it was easy
for us to keep this great adventure a secret. I knew
well enough that my father, had he known, would
have no faith in it, nor could he give me any money
for such an undertaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whenever the artists reached a new town their first
problem was to locate a piano and to persuade the
owner to contribute the use of it to the evening&rsquo;s concert.
The second problem was to get the piano moved
to the hall where the concert was to be played. This
was easier, the boys soon found, in a town which
housed a military garrison. The good-natured soldiers
were always willing to carry the piano in exchange
for a glass of vodka. Since every soldier had a different
theory about the proper way to move a piano, the entire
garrison ended up as an escort. The sight of thirty
or forty soldiers surging through the street after a
piano, and all arguing at once, was good free advertising.
No one in town could long remain unaware of
the fact that a concert was to be played that night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>The first few concerts were quite successful and the
three artists moved on, by train, by bus, or on foot,
further and further to the north. But as summer faded
and the temperature began to drop, the cellist gave
notice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back to Warsaw,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and if
you have any sense, you&rsquo;ll come too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing!&rdquo; violinist Ignace replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s on
to St. Petersburg for us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not as adventurous as you are. Goodbye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus the trio became a duo. As the boys turned
north and crossed into Russia, they suddenly found
themselves in mid-winter. They lined their thin clothing
with newspaper and pressed on. They were forced
to admit that their brief summer success was over.
Soon they were penniless and hungry. Ignace-the-violinist
gave in first and wrote home for money.
Finally Ignace-the-pianist had to break his resolution
and do the same. The fathers of both boys sent money
immediately and told the lads to be on the next train
home. The violinist was delighted to follow orders.
The pianist was more stubborn. &ldquo;If only I could get
to Petersburg. If only I could play one successful concert
there!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as easy to get home
from there as it is from here. Easier in fact. Just one
more chance! It&rsquo;s all I ask. Father wouldn&rsquo;t really
mind!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>He went on alone to Petersburg. And then real disaster
struck. Both his baggage and the money he had
counted on for his return home were stolen. He found
himself absolutely penniless and half starved in a
strange, unfriendly city. Fortunately for Ignace, not
everyone in it was unfriendly. A poor plumber took
the boy in off the street to save him from freezing to
death. With nothing to do all day but try to stay
warm, Ignace had plenty of time to think over his
foolishness. He had no idea what to do next. On one
point, however, he was adamant. He would not write
his father again. &ldquo;How can I?&rdquo; he said to the friendly
plumber. &ldquo;He already sent me more than he could
afford. And I lost it! I can&rsquo;t ask him for more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few days later the janitor of the building came to
the plumber&rsquo;s little basement room and said, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
your name Paderewski? There&rsquo;s a letter for you at
the General Delivery window of the Post Office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me? But that&rsquo;s impossible. From whom?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;From a Jan Paderewski. The Post Office has been
asking for you all over town. Just by chance I heard
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The letter from home enclosed a hundred rubles.
Ignace left Petersburg the next day and was soon safe
at home in Sudylkow, thinner but considerably wiser
than he had been a year before. One question had
haunted him all the way home. &ldquo;How did you know
where to find me?&rdquo; he asked his father. &ldquo;And how did
you know how desperately I needed that money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that was easy,&rdquo; Mr. Paderewski said. &ldquo;You
see, I had a dream. I saw you hungry and cold in St.
Petersburg, so I sent the letter to the Post Office there
and begged them to look for you. The surprising
thing is that they found you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fact that his father&rsquo;s intense love for him had
worked a small miracle on his behalf touched the
boy&rsquo;s heart so deeply that he made an immediate resolution.
He would repay his father&rsquo;s goodness by doing
exactly as his father wanted. He would go back to
the Conservatory and finish his studies with no more
nonsense. Nor would he put his father to any more
years of expense than the good man had originally expected.
He was now two years behind his own classmates,
but he vowed that somehow he would graduate
with them. This gave him six months in which to
complete the regular work of two years!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>During these months of intensive study, young
Ignace began to develop the gift that would carry
him through so many crises in his life: an enormous
power of concentration.</p>
<p>On graduation day Mr. Paderewski was in the hall,
sick at heart because he did not really believe that his
son could possibly have passed the rigorous final examinations
for the music diploma. As the list of the
names was read, as one boy after another went up to
the platform, the nervous father braced himself. &ldquo;But
of course his name will not be called. How could it
be? The others in the class have been working an
extra year and a half ... There ... that&rsquo;s the last
boy going up now, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was not quite the last boy. The last boy was
now being called. &ldquo;And finally,&rdquo; the Director announced,
beaming, &ldquo;with the highest honors of the
class, Ignace Jan Paderewski.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Mr. Paderewski remembered few details after that.
All twelve Kerntopfs were trying to shake his hand
at once, and then Ignace was playing the Grieg Piano
Concerto with the orchestra, and everyone in the hall
was cheering for him. Then the father realized something
that must have made him even happier than this
moment of triumph: in six short months young Ignace
must have done quite a bit of growing up.</p>

<div class="img">

</div>
<p>Now that Paderewski had his diploma, he determined
that he would no longer be an expense to his
father. Much as the young man disliked teaching (a
dislike from which he never recovered), he knew he
had no choice in the matter. If he intended to eat, he
would have to teach. But at least he did not have to
look very hard for pupils. Immediately after graduation
he was offered a position on the faculty of the
Conservatory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Among the students that year was a beautiful
young girl named Antonina Korsak. Although Paderewski&rsquo;s
future was uncertain, Antonina had complete
faith in it. It did not matter in the least to her
that at the moment he was only a struggling, poorly-paid
piano teacher. In 1880, when Paderewski had just
turned twenty, they were married.</p>
<p>He found a small apartment where the two talented
young musicians lived in complete happiness and
made glowing plans for the future. Paderewski would
look back on it as though he were recalling a brief but
unforgettable dream. One year after her marriage the
beautiful Antonina was dead, leaving her young husband
with an infant son.</p>
<p>During her last conscious hours, Antonina, knowing
that she was dying, had made her husband promise
to take some of her small inheritance and use it to continue
his musical studies. Her faith in his future was as
bright and untroubled at the moment of her death as
it had been during her life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Now that he had a son to support, Paderewski
knew that he must be practical. Nearly everyone who
knew anything about it assured him that although he
could never make a career as a pianist, he would be a
success as a composer. Since no one in Warsaw could
teach him any more than he already knew about composition,
he decided to go to Berlin to study with a
famous teacher named Friederich Kiel. Antonina&rsquo;s
mother happily agreed to take care of little Alfred for
him.</p>
<p>Professor Kiel was greatly impressed both by Paderewski&rsquo;s
talent as a composer and by the young
Pole&rsquo;s enormous capacity for work. Too saddened by
his wife&rsquo;s death to enjoy the boisterous student life of
Berlin, Paderewski devoted himself entirely to his
studies. Ten or twelve hours a day of uninterrupted
work was not the least unusual.</p>
<p>Although most Berliners were automatically anti-Polish,
Paderewski made some good friends among
German musicians. His warmest affection was for the
great composer, Richard Strauss, whose family accepted
the young foreigner as a member from his first
appearance in the house. Of all his kindnesses to Paderewski,
the greatest favor Strauss ever did for him
was a completely unconscious one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Paderewski knew that he had the habit of making
faces while he played the piano. The more complex
the music, the more tortured the grimaces that distorted
his handsome face. He had never given the failing
much thought, however, until he realized that
Strauss had the same bad habit. As he watched the
great man play&mdash;his face almost as busy as his hands&mdash;Paderewski
thought, &ldquo;Good Heavens! That is how I
look!&rdquo; He determined to reform at all costs and did
so, but only after months of practicing with a mirror
propped up on the music rack of the piano.</p>
<p>Although he did not forget his promise to Antonina
to continue his studies, he worried more and more
about earning money for his little son. The music he
published brought him a great deal of praise but little
money. But he soon found a way to increase his earnings.
He was in great demand as an accompanist for
violinists and singers, since he could sight read music
so brilliantly that the performers who hired him did
not have to spend much time or money on rehearsals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>One of his closest friends was a violinist named
Gorski. He had arranged a short tour of resort hotels,
and he asked Paderewski to come with him. The
pianist smiled to himself, remembering an earlier tour
he had once made. But since this one was on a much
sounder financial footing, he gladly agreed to go.
There was a marked resemblance, however, in the
matter of pianos!</p>
<p>At the very first hotel where they were booked, the
piano proved to be of such ancient stock that half the
hammers had resigned from active duty. When he
struck the keys attached to the afflicted hammer they
would fly up, but once up they would not return to
place. This meant that each note with a bad hammer
could only be used once during the evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can probably play your accompaniments by faking!&rdquo;
he said to Gorski, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t possibly get
through my solos!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can we do? It&rsquo;s the only piano in town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of Gorski&rsquo;s young pupils was making the tour
with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, sir,&rdquo; he said, stepping up timidly. &ldquo;I
think I can help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; Paderewski said gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose I stand by the piano and push the hammers
down just as fast as you hit them. I don&rsquo;t think
the audience would notice, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>The two artists looked at each other and shrugged.
It was worth a try, since there was nothing else to do.
In later years, Paderewski loved to tell this story. &ldquo;Ah!
You should have seen him!&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;His hands
went like lightning. They flew like birds from side to
side. He had to lean way across the piano&mdash;back and
forth he weaved and darted in constant motion....
What an experience!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The concert was a huge success. The clever hammer-pusher
had been wrong in only one respect: his
modest belief that the audience would not notice him.
After the concert as Paderewski was walking through
the lobby, he heard a man say to his wife, &ldquo;How did
you like that young pianist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he was all right,&rdquo; came the answer, &ldquo;but the
other one, you know! The second pianist who was
playing at the back of the piano! He was the best, I
thought. He worked much harder than the other one.
He was the real artist!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Paderewski worked nearly two years in Berlin,
interrupted only by a short period of teaching in
Warsaw. There, in addition to a heavy teaching program,
he began taking private lessons in Latin, mathematics,
literature, and history. He did not want his
education to be completely one-sided. He had, at the
time, no way of realizing how wise a decision this was.</p>
<p>Paderewski&rsquo;s studies in composition had been brilliant,
and the piano pieces he published were unusually
successful. One of the first pianists to play his
work in public was the popular Madame Essipoff. She
included his Variations in A minor on many of her
programs. To Paderewski, however, Essipoff&rsquo;s greatest
attraction was not her success as a pianist but the
fact that she was married to the great Theodore
Leschetizky.</p>
<p>Leschetizky lived in Vienna, but he was a fellow
Pole. He was, in addition, the most famous piano
teacher in the world.</p>
<p>The thought of a piano career had remained at the
back of Paderewski&rsquo;s mind during every minute of
his years in Warsaw and Berlin, although reason told
him to abandon the idea. (So had every teacher with
whom he had ever studied.) The turning point in his
thinking came about quite casually.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>One night his publisher invited him to dinner to
meet Anton Rubinstein, a brilliant and famous concert
pianist. (He occupied much the same position in
his day as his namesake, Artur Rubinstein, occupies
in ours.)</p>
<p>The famous pianist was charming to the relatively
unknown composer and asked to hear some of his
piano compositions. When Paderewski had played
several pieces, Rubinstein said, &ldquo;How very fine they
are! You must compose more for the piano!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paderewski smiled diffidently. &ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t do too
well writing for piano,&rdquo; he said modestly, &ldquo;because I
play so little myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rubinstein&rsquo;s eyebrows lifted. &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You have an inborn technique. You could have a
splendid piano career, if you wanted one. I&rsquo;m sure of
it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>For a moment the young man was too stunned to
mumble a polite reply. It was true that this opinion
was only one against many others in the opposite direction.
But it was Anton Rubinstein&rsquo;s opinion, and
that gave it a few extra votes. In any case it was all
that was needed to decide the young man&rsquo;s future.
Somehow he would manage the impossible task of
raising the money to study the piano seriously. It was
his last chance, if indeed it was not already too late,
so he could not afford to settle for anything but the
best. He would go to Vienna and study with Leschetizky.</p>
<p>Before he could even think about the future,
though, he knew that he needed a rest. The years of
intensive work, compounded by a constant uneasiness
about his little boy&rsquo;s delicate health, had exhausted
him. He decided to spend a few weeks in the beautiful
Tatra Mountains. There he could think things out&mdash;and
start adding up figures. What would a few months
in Vienna cost? How much did Leschetizky usually
charge per lesson? What was the quickest way to raise
the money? The last question was a tricky one, since
there was no quick way to raise money. It would have
to be done piecemeal.</p>
<p>In the village of Zakopane where he stayed, there
lived an old doctor who was an expert on the folk
music of the region. Paderewski tramped happily
through the hills with his new friend, jotting down
notes as fast as the good old man could whistle them.
One day the doctor said, &ldquo;Guess who arrived in the
village to open up her summer home? Helen Modjeska!
Would you like to meet her?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Paderewski gasped. &ldquo;Modjeska? Here? Certainly
I&rsquo;d like to meet her!&rdquo; Who wouldn&rsquo;t? How many
times he had cheered himself hoarse over a Modjeska
performance in <i>Hamlet</i> or <i>Othello</i>! Poles all over the
world loved Modjeska, not only because she was a
great actress, but also because she was dedicated heart
and soul to the cause of a free Poland. Since she was
one of the most famous actresses in the world, she had
done as much as anyone alive to remind the world
that there was such a place as Poland.</p>
<p>Modjeska and her husband were delighted with the
handsome young musician, and when he played the
piano for her the actress was enchanted. &ldquo;You will
have a great career!&rdquo; she predicted. &ldquo;You will do great
honor to your country. But you must start at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paderewski smiled. Non-musicians simply did not
understand these things! &ldquo;You are kind, Madame! But
I am not ready to start. Not until I have studied much
more. And that is not easy to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Studying costs money.&rdquo; She frowned. &ldquo;I understand
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll raise it somehow. Maybe if I give
a few hundred concerts! Next month I&rsquo;m giving a
little recital in Cracow. It might even fill about one
quarter of a hall&mdash;if the hall is small enough.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>The actress&rsquo;s beautiful dark eyes flashed. &ldquo;Nonsense!
The hall will be filled! Sold out! There will not
be an empty seat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Madame.&rdquo; Paderewski laughed delightedly.
&ldquo;You are very flattering, but I&rsquo;m afraid the
people of Cracow won&rsquo;t quite turn out <i>en masse</i> to
hear me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not. Not yet&mdash;but they might just turn
out to hear <i>me</i>. We shall make it a double bill.
Paderewski plays, Modjeska recites! What do you
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment he was too stunned to say anything
at all.</p>
<p>The hall was indeed sold out and the box-office
&ldquo;take&rdquo; was at least five times greater than the poor
pianist had expected. Modjeska&rsquo;s name on the program
was the greatest endorsement he could have had
in Cracow. People flocked to hear her recite from
the beloved Polish poets. They stayed to hear the unknown
pianist play his persuasive brand of Chopin.
In one evening he had earned enough to live in Vienna
for at least three months. The &ldquo;right person at the
right moment&rdquo; pattern was once more in evidence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p class="tb">In 1886 Vienna was the heart of the musical world.
The great composer, Johannes Brahms, lived and
worked there. The Vienna Philharmonic was the oldest
and finest symphony orchestra in the world. The
Vienna State Opera was producing its almost flawless
productions under some of the world&rsquo;s finest conductors.
Johann Strauss was writing operettas such as
<i>Die Fledermaus</i> and &ldquo;The Gypsy Baron,&rdquo; while the
whole country waltzed to the &ldquo;Beautiful Blue Danube&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Tales From the Vienna Woods.&rdquo; To the
hopeful young Polish pianist, however, the center of
Vienna&rsquo;s musical life was the studio of Theodore
Leschetizky.</p>
<p>From the phenomenally early age of fifteen, Leschetizky
had been recognized as a remarkable teacher,
and while he himself played publicly until he was past
fifty, his greatest gift was the ability to make superb
pianists out of the advanced students who came to him
from all over the world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<div class="img" id="pic4">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="438" height="800" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;<i>Play something for me.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>When Paderewski called on Leschetizky, the great
man received him cordially. &ldquo;Of course! You are the
young man whose music my wife so admires! Many
young composers are kind enough to bring me their
new compositions. You have some pieces to play for
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paderewski gulped. Now that he had to put it into
words, his mission suddenly looked a bit ridiculous.
As clearly as he could, he explained to Leschetizky
that he had not come to him as a composer but as a
piano student, since he wanted to have a career as a
concert pianist.</p>
<p>The older man&rsquo;s bushy eyebrows flew up. &ldquo;Are
you serious? But&mdash;how old are you, young man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And at twenty-four you intend to start studying
to be a virtuoso? Do you realize what you are saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although a man is still very young at twenty-four,
he is far too old to begin a new career as a pianist.
Either he should be well on his way to an established
reputation by that age, or he should forget the whole
thing. Paderewski knew this as well as anyone.</p>
<p>Leschetizky was now pacing up and down the
room nervously. &ldquo;It is impossible, I tell you! Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Paderewski felt as though the world were crumbling
into bits and pieces. Seeing the look on his face,
the good-natured professor said more kindly, &ldquo;Well,
well&mdash;since you are here, play something for me. It
does not matter what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With what desperation Paderewski must have
poured into his playing the emotions that were surging
through his head at that moment! He played his
own compositions, since he knew little else. When
he had finished, Leschetizky, who had stopped pacing,
said quietly, &ldquo;You have a great many qualities as a
pianist. You have a natural technique, but it lacks so
much. Still, you have the principal quality&mdash;that is
tone.&rdquo; He frowned and shook his head sadly, &ldquo;But I
am afraid there will be too much to do with your fingers.
They absolutely lack discipline. Besides,&rdquo; he
added, cutting directly to the heart of the problem, &ldquo;I
am afraid you do not know how to work!&rdquo; This was
the thing that Paderewski had known all along. It was,
in fact, the reason he had decided he must study with
Leschetizky. &ldquo;If I decide to give you lessons,&rdquo; Leschetizky
was saying, &ldquo;you must start with finger exercises
and with Czerny studies.&rdquo; This was where all
well-trained beginners started. But it was also the way
that every Leschetizky pupil, no matter how advanced,
had to begin working towards his lofty goals:
absolute mastery of each finger, and a beautiful, singing
tone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Now Paderewski knew how someone feels who
must begin learning to walk all over again after a leg
injury. As he thumped out his scales and exercises, he
realized more clearly than ever how slipshod his playing
really was. &ldquo;I could not improve in a few weeks
or months even, because bad habits were already
deeply rooted in me, an amateurish way of treating
the piano, just play the piano, fingering&mdash;anyhow!&rdquo;
No wonder poor Leschetizky almost gave up hope
during the early days. &ldquo;No, no, it&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo; he
would say, tugging nervously at his beard. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too
late! It&rsquo;s too late! You have wasted your time on pleasant
things like orchestration!&rdquo; And here he would add
the most heart-breaking judgment of all: &ldquo;Ah, but if
you had begun to study earlier. Then you could
have become a great pianist!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>But Leschetizky had not reckoned with Paderewski&rsquo;s
stubborn determination to work. He practiced
seven or eight exhausting hours a day. By the end of
each session he felt as though his arms would drop off
at the shoulder. There was no time in his life now for
anything but work. He who had such a gift for
friendship now found that his closest friend was a
little spider who ran down a thread and sat on the
music rack while he practiced.</p>
<p>In spite of his Spartan existence, Paderewski was
completely happy. He knew that he had, at last, found
exactly the man he needed. &ldquo;He opened up another
world to me,&rdquo; he wrote later. &ldquo;After those groping,
struggling years, even in a few lessons things became
clear. I began to see, to understand, to know how to
work. And my thankfulness to Leschetizky is as great
today as it was then!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>But life in Vienna was expensive, and although the
generous Leschetizky refused to take any money at
all for these priceless lessons, Paderewski&rsquo;s small supply
of cash finally ran out. Through Leschetizky&rsquo;s
influence he was offered a decently paid post at the
Strasbourg Conservatory. During that year, he played
five important public concerts. The more he played,
the more he could see not only how far he had come
but how far he still had to go. When the school term
was over, he left Strasbourg, determined to get back
to Vienna and Leschetizky at all costs. But how?</p>
<p>Once more it was Edward Kerntopf who came to
his rescue. He insisted on giving his friend the necessary
money. Much as Paderewski hated to impose his
problems on anyone else, he felt a strong conviction
that some day, in some small way, he would be able to
repay Edward&rsquo;s kindness.</p>
<p>And so back to Vienna and Leschetizky, and those
driving hours of work. But this time it was different.
This time both student and teacher knew that the impossible
was actually going to happen.</p>
<p>Before Paderewski had been in Vienna many
months, Leschetizky came to his room one day and
said, &ldquo;I have a suggestion to make to you. Would you
not like to make your first appearance here in Vienna?
Pauline Lucca&mdash;she is such a beautiful singer!&mdash;is doing
a charity concert. She wants to have a pianist on the
program too. It&rsquo;s a good opportunity. I think you
should take it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I shall be glad to,&rdquo; Paderewski said, his eyes
shining. What delighted him to the point of dancing
was not the idea of the concert itself. That was just a
matter of playing a few pieces during the program so
that the singer could rest her voice. What filled his
soul with joy was the fact that Leschetizky himself
believed he was ready for his debut in Vienna!</p>

</div>
<p>Nearly all the musicians in Paris came to the piano
recital given at the Salle Erard on the evening of
March 3, 1889. The French composers Gounod, Massenet,
and Saint-Saens were there. So was their famous
Russian colleague, Tchaikovsky. It was the sort of
audience that is usually described as &ldquo;small but distinguished.&rdquo;
It included many members of the Polish
aristocracy in exile who lived in Paris, their &ldquo;second
capital.&rdquo; And they had brought with them whatever
friends among the French nobility they could round
up for the occasion. It made no difference to them
that they had never even heard the name of the young
man who was playing. The fact that this Ignace Jan
Paderewski was a Polish artist was all they needed to
know about him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>From Paderewski&rsquo;s point of view, however, the two
most important people in the audience were two
Frenchmen named Edouard Colonne and Charles Lamoureux.
Both men were conductors of highly successful
orchestras bearing their names. And each man
was not only constantly on the alert for new talent,
but was eager to be first in bringing it before the
public.</p>
<p>Paderewski sat in his dressing room before the concert,
completely alone, as was his habit. He was not
thinking about the audience or anything else in the
world except the music he would soon be playing:
Beethoven&rsquo;s Thirty-Two Variations in C minor;
some Chopin (whose music he loved above any other
and which he felt that he, a Pole, could play as Paris
had not heard it before), and one of the most brilliant
and fiery of the Hungarian Rhapsodies by Liszt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>The manager of the hall had been surprised when
the young visitor had asked to have the lights lowered
to about half their usual brightness. So was the audience,
accustomed as it was to recitals played with the
gaslight blazing at full power. But early in his concert
career Paderewski had found that a bright light on
the keys of the piano made it almost impossible for
him to play.</p>
<p>What happened that night in the Salle Erard?</p>
<p>We have a report about it from a man who was
himself one of the world&rsquo;s greatest pianists, and no
tribute can be held in higher regard than that spoken
by one artist about another. Alfred Cortot said of
Paderewski&rsquo;s Paris debut, &ldquo;He appeared with the suddenness
of a lightning stroke, making a blurring, an
eruption in our hearts. Instead of a pianist, an inspired
poet took possession of the keyboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The listeners, charmed from the first moment by
the romantic appearance of the newcomer, grew more
and more enthusiastic with each succeeding piece. But
after the last encore&mdash;the encores lasted for nearly an
hour&mdash;the audience was on its feet thundering its approval.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Two men in the audience had better things to do
than shout and applaud. The minute the last note had
died away, conductors Colonne and Lamoureux
leaped to their feet and began a race to the platform.
Each man was determined to get there first. Lamoureux,
by a masterpiece of broken field running
around cheering Polish counts, French dukes, and
assorted musicians, won the race. &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; he
puffed, hearing Colonne slide to a stop behind him, &ldquo;I
have the honor to invite you to appear as soloist in
three weeks with the Lamoureux Orchestra!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamoureux and other new friends pressed the
young pianist to arrange several additional solo recitals
at once. &ldquo;You must strike again while this enthusiasm
lasts,&rdquo; they told him. &ldquo;You must reinforce
this first success, or people will quickly forget you.&rdquo;
All professional artists are aware of the fickleness of
the public. Paderewski knew what good advice his
friends were giving him. The night&rsquo;s triumph, therefore,
instead of making him happy, plunged him into
absolute misery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Why? Because the modest young man, encouraged
to try his luck by his success in Vienna, had come to
Paris with exactly one program prepared. And he had
just finished playing it! He could have postponed his
Paris debut until he had a larger repertoire, but it had
never once occurred to him that he would be called
upon to play anything in Paris but his one recital. And
now!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; he told himself on that triumphant
evening of March 3. The first program&mdash;the
<i>only</i> program&mdash;had taken him eight months to prepare
to his satisfaction. Now he was asked to prepare a
second program in three weeks! &ldquo;It&rsquo;s absolutely impossible!
I can&rsquo;t even think about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the morning of March 4, he said, &ldquo;Well&mdash;maybe
I could try&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the evening of March 23 he appeared with the
Lamoureux Orchestra in the Saint-Saens Piano Concerto
in C minor. He played it, said the city&rsquo;s toughest
music critic, &ldquo;in a superb and masterful manner.&rdquo;
Critics should be embarrassed, the writer added, to
praise Paderewski, because they had been so free and
easy in using superlatives to describe other pianists.
As a result, there was now a shortage of new words by
which to describe the particular genius of the Polish
artist. Another newspaper promptly labelled him &ldquo;the
Lion of Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>The faster Paderewski&rsquo;s career gathered speed, the
harder he worked, &ldquo;always struggling for perfection,
pushing on and on to that ever-receding faraway peak
of attainment,&rdquo; he would write of those days. &ldquo;All
work is like that.... The summit of the mountain is
always farther and farther away.&rdquo; He went back to
Vienna and prepared more and more programs, and
added concerto after concerto to his growing list. He
accepted more and better engagements with bigger
and bigger box office receipts to show for them. He
toured the French provinces&mdash;Lyons ... Nantes ...
Bordeaux ... Tours.... Then on to Antwerp
... Brussels ... Li&egrave;ge ... and Vienna again. And
always Paris. After three successful seasons in Paris
he felt like a real veteran of the concert stage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>The financial rewards of success were important to
him because of Alfred, who was now nine years old.
It had been evident from the time he was a year old
that the little boy, mentally so alert, was not developing
well physically. In those days doctors could
do very little to improve or even to diagnose his condition.
It would seem that he suffered from a congenital
weakness of the spine, and possibly of the heart.
&ldquo;Always in the foreground,&rdquo; his father wrote, &ldquo;was
the menace of his illness, a constantly increasing
problem to be met. He had his tutors at this time
and he was intelligent and gifted. He had a brilliant,
clear mind; he loved music too. It was difficult to
take him to concerts, but he often went to recitals
at the Salle Erard which we could manage easily
and he was very happy to go, and touchingly proud
of me at these concerts. It was a great excitement
to him, a stimulant to his mind. Poor child, he was
completely cut off from everything in life except intellectual
things, by his great infirmity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father and son were together at last. And Paderewski
had accepted the fact that the boy would never
walk. In Paris Alfred was cared for in the home of
the beautiful Mme. Helena Gorska, a friend who gave
great love and kindness to the motherless boy and
therefore much peace of mind to his father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Paderewski&rsquo;s reputation made possible another
long-awaited opportunity. In 1889, a great exhibition&mdash;a
sort of World&rsquo;s Fair&mdash;was held in Paris. It included
a display of pianos from all over the world. Paderewski
arranged to have some Kerntopf pianos, up to then
known only in Poland, shipped to Paris and exhibited.
They won a gold medal (after Paderewski had happily
and cleverly used every ounce of influence he had
with every one of the judges). The fact that his pianos&mdash;Polish
pianos&mdash;had come out so well in international
competition was one of the greatest events in Edward
Kerntopf&rsquo;s life. It would never be possible to repay
Edward&rsquo;s kindness, Paderewski thought, but at least
he had been able to do something. Many people who
reach sudden, dazzling success find it all too easy to
forget the people who helped to bring it about. It was
one of Paderewski&rsquo;s principal characteristics, from his
boyhood to his old age, that he never forgot his friends
at home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>The road had led him from Warsaw to Vienna to
Paris. To continue his conquest of the musical world,
Paderewski now turned to London. As his ship
pitched its way across the Channel, the seasick artist
was in no mood for optimism. The conquest of one
city, he knew, did not guarantee success in another
city. London in particular had always maintained a
chilly &ldquo;show me&rdquo; attitude toward artists who came
supplied with flowery reviews from foreign critics.
Naturally anyone who arrived in the British capital
preceded by rave notices like Paderewski&rsquo;s would be
under high suspicion.</p>
<p>It came as a nasty shock to Paderewski to find that
his London manager, Daniel Mayer, a beginner in the
field, had plastered the city with posters advertising
the appearance of the &ldquo;Lion of Paris.&rdquo; Paderewski, a
Pole, knew better than the English Mr. Mayer that
Londoners simply did not care for this sort of thing.
&ldquo;You make me sound like an incoming circus,&rdquo; he
roared at his overeager manager.</p>
<p>Paderewski&rsquo;s gloomy predictions about his first
London appearance turned out to be one hundred percent
correct. The night was wet and foggy; the hall
was half empty; the audience was chilly. The artist,
so sensitive to the emotions of the audience, was appalled.
And the reviews were ghastly. &ldquo;Vulgar,&rdquo; &ldquo;violent,&rdquo;
&ldquo;much noise and little music,&rdquo; &ldquo;the clay and the
jangle of metal,&rdquo; he read about himself in the London
papers. The critics seemed determined to cut the lion
down to the size of a small tabby cat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Today we have our own opinion about the cautious
critics who complained so bitterly because Paderewski&rsquo;s
playing was &ldquo;utterly at variance with the traditional
methods.&rdquo; In England the &ldquo;traditional methods&rdquo;
of playing certain unfortunate composers often meant
rather spineless, languishing, ladylike performances.
Paderewski&rsquo;s intense vitality and virility startled the
conservative critics of that Victorian era. It would
take some getting used to!</p>
<p>After two slightly more successful London concerts,
Paderewski went on a tour of the smaller cities.
Poor Mr. Daniel Mayer set out on the road with a
heavy heart, for he looked forward to financial disaster.
To his horror, Paderewski had firmly insisted
that his publicity circulars for the provinces should
reprint all his London reviews complete! Mr. Mayer,
like every other manager in the business, believed in
picking out the best and kindest remarks from reviews
and cleverly stringing them together with &ldquo;...&rdquo; and
&ldquo;...,&rdquo; thus giving the impression that all the critics
had thought everything was wonderful. Yet Paderewski
had vetoed this simple business procedure for a
reason that appalled his poor manager. He said it was
dishonest. Dishonest! Who cared about honesty in
publicity releases, Mr. Mayer moaned to himself. Results
at the box office were what counted! And who
had ever heard of a rising concert artist with a conscience.
It was a luxury he could not afford.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>

<p class="caption"><i>The admiring lady was Queen Victoria.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>To Mr. Mayer&rsquo;s vast surprise, Paderewski&rsquo;s honesty
turned out to be the best policy, financially as well as
morally. The people of the smaller English towns felt&mdash;quite
correctly&mdash;that Londoners looked down on
them. For this reason they leaned over backwards to
avoid following the lead of the big city in making decisions
about anything, even the abilities of an unknown
artist. The very fact that the London critics
had given him rough treatment was a point in his
favor. And the fact that he had circulated all of his
reviews, good and bad, piqued their curiosity as nothing
else could have done. Curiosity and sympathy are
a powerful combination at the box office.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>Paderewski finished his tour with the sweet sounds
of success ringing in his ears. By the time he returned
to London, his complete triumph all over the rest of
England had been duly noticed. The lines formed at
dawn outside the box office of St. James Hall on the
days of his concerts.</p>
<p>His appealing personality and flawless manners
quickly made Paderewski a popular figure in London
society. He made friends among British statesmen as
easily as he did among British musicians. The former
gentlemen were surprised at his grasp of so many subjects
besides music. And the authority with which this
romantic-looking, golden-haired pianist discussed international
affairs astounded them. The composer
Saint-Saens had, with typical French acumen, already
summed up Paderewski&rsquo;s gifts. &ldquo;Paderewski?&rdquo; he had
said one evening, shortly after the Paris debut. &ldquo;He is
a genius who happens to play the piano!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>It was at this time that the most famous of all
Paderewski portraits was made. It was a pencil drawing
by the distinguished British artist, Edward Burne-Jones.
The picture came into being in a delightful
way. As Burne-Jones was walking down the street
one day, he passed a young man with a radiant face
and a halo of red-gold hair. The artist was so struck
by this apparition that he rushed around the block
quickly in order to pass it again. Then he rushed back
home and announced to the astonished household, &ldquo;I
have just seen an archangel walking on the London
pavement!&rdquo; He grabbed a pencil and rapidly sketched
what he could remember of the archangel&rsquo;s appearance.</p>
<p>A few days later Paderewski was brought by a mutual
friend to pay a call on Burne-Jones. Much to his
surprise he was met by his host not with a polite British
greeting, but with an ecstatic cry, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my archangel!&rdquo;
Before the astonished visitor could say a word,
the artist had seized the unfinished picture and gone
to work on it.</p>
<p>A lady who heard him play that year wrote about
it this way in her diary: &ldquo;Went to the green drawing
room and heard Monsieur Paderewski play on the
piano. He does so quite marvelously, such power and
such tender feeling. I really think he is quite equal to
Rubinstein. He is young, about 28, with a sort of aureole
of red hair standing out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>The admiring lady was Queen Victoria. Another
victory had been won in his complete conquest of
England.</p>
<p>It was time to move on now and the logical world
to be conquered next was the new one. In 1891, the
firm of Steinway and Sons in New York offered Paderewski
a contract for eighty concerts with a guarantee
of $30,000. What young artist could refuse
such an offer? On November 3, 1891, Paderewski
sailed for New York.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/ceagle.jpg" alt="Coat of arms with Eagle." width="300" height="320" />
</div>
<p>Carnegie Hall in New York City has been the goal
of musicians from all over the world for nearly three
quarters of a century. But on November 17, 1891,
when the new European artist first played there for
an audience that had paid a total of only $500 to hear
him, the famous hall was barely six months old.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Paderewski was still slightly numb from his first
impressions of the world he had come to conquer!
After a long, rough crossing, his ship had docked late
on a rainy night. In those days the first view of New
York from the harbor was by no means the thrilling
sight it is today. The famous skyline did not yet exist
and the unlit waterfront consisted of a few dirty, low-lying
buildings.</p>
<p>Almost as depressing as the scenery was Mr. Charles
F. Tretbar, the Steinway representative who met him
at the dock with this cheering welcome: &ldquo;Well, Mr.
Paderewski, we hear you have had a brilliant success
in London and Paris. But let me tell you, you need
not expect anything like that here in America. We
have heard them all, all the pianists, all the great ones,
and our demands are very exacting. We are not easily
pleased here! Besides, everyone knows that piano
playing is not as well rewarded as singing or violin
playing, so don&rsquo;t expect any extraordinary audiences.
I&rsquo;ve done my best for you, but it won&rsquo;t amount to
much!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Paderewski, his secretary, and his luggage, were
then deposited at a dismal hotel in Union Square
where the two men spent the night routing battalions
of mice and bedbugs. Although they were moved to
a good hotel the next day, with the profound apologies
of Mr. Steinway himself, the lost night had not
helped to put Paderewski in a festive mood for his first
concert. Nor had his first look at the schedule of his
tour arranged by Mr. Tretbar. To his dismay, he
found that he was advertised for six solo recitals and
three concerts with orchestra during the first two
weeks. Each orchestral concert included two concertos.
He would be playing six different concertos
within six days.</p>
<p>Paderewski was learning the hard way about the
energetic all-out American way of doing things! In
Europe, a pianist who played six different concertos
in one season, much less one week, would be considered
a wonder. Four of the concertos he could
easily manage, but the other two, although he had
played them once or twice, were not really ready for
public performance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>All of these troublesome facts, however, he put
out of his mind when he walked out onto the stage
of Carnegie Hall for the first time and began to play
the Saint-Saens C minor Concerto. It was the same
work he had played with the Lamoureux Orchestra
in Paris. This time he was accompanied by the Symphony
Society of New York City, under its handsome
young conductor, Walter Damrosch. The evening
closed with his own concerto, which gave the
New York critics a chance to judge him as a composer
as well as a pianist.</p>
<p>But poor Paderewski had little time after the concert
that night to worry about the next day&rsquo;s reviews.
Damrosch had scheduled the rehearsal for the next
concert at ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning. And at this
second concert he was to play not only the Beethoven
&ldquo;Emperor&rdquo; Concerto and the Schumann Concerto,
but, as a bonus for the audience, the fiendishly difficult
Hungarian Fantasia for piano and orchestra by Liszt.</p>
<p>Paderewski went back to his new hotel physically
exhausted, as always after a concert, and began practicing
for the next day&rsquo;s work. He had not struck
more than six chords before there was an agitated
knocking at the door. The manager of the hotel stood
outside, wringing his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Paderewski! Playing the piano at this hour?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I have to practice for my next concert. And
nighttime is the only time I have free!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but Mr. Paderewski, we have so many elderly
people living in the hotel. We can&rsquo;t possibly have you
practicing the piano at midnight. You can understand
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could understand it, yes, but what could he do
about it? Suddenly from the depth of his memory
came a clear picture of the Kerntopf factory in Warsaw,
with its room after room of inviting pianos. He
grabbed his coat and called to his secretary, &ldquo;Goerlitz!
Come on! We&rsquo;re going out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going out? At this hour? Where to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Steinway warehouse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nightwatchman at the Fourteenth Street office
was surprised to be roused from his slumbers by a
wild-eyed man pounding at the door. &ldquo;I must have
presented a strange appearance,&rdquo; Paderewski recalled.
&ldquo;The watchman, however, opened the room where
the pianos were stored, and there, in that cold and
gloomy loft, I began practicing. There were no lights
except the two candles on the piano. It must have been
a strange sight as I think back on it&mdash;the empty room,
with two fluttering candles and the two men, the
night watchman and my secretary, each snoring
loudly in his corner as I worked on until morning.
That was all I had for inspiration!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Yet in spite of his fatigue, this concert was a greater
success than the first one. The reviews of the debut
had been of the sort usually described as &ldquo;mixed.&rdquo; But
after the second concert the <i>New York Times</i> headlined
its account with the flat statement, &ldquo;The Success
of Ignace Jan Paderewski is Assured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His success might be assured, but poor Ignace Jan
Paderewski himself was in sad shape as he doggedly
returned to the Steinway warehouse to practice the
arm-wrenching Rubinstein Concerto. How long, he
wondered, could he go on at his present pace? No
wonder Rubinstein himself had made only one American
tour in his life and had said, when begged to return,
&ldquo;May Heaven preserve us from such slavery!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>The third concert, a matinee for which he had
practiced a total of seventeen hours, was an unqualified
triumph, &ldquo;the real beginning of my career in
America.&rdquo; It was not only the critics who were ecstatic.
So was Mr. Tretbar. Three thousand dollars,
an unheard-of amount of money for a single concert,
was taken in at the box office. By the end of the season,
Paderewski&rsquo;s appearance in the same hall would
bring in nearly twice that amount.</p>
<p>Mr. Steinway himself, although pleased by the box
office receipts, did not really care whether he made
money out of these concerts. The Steinway firm had
thought of the Paderewski tour as a means of advertising
its pianos. And what an inspiration the idea
turned out to be! In the mind of the public the name
&ldquo;Steinway&rdquo; became inextricably linked with the name
&ldquo;Paderewski,&rdquo; and the latter was about to move into
the household-word category.</p>
<p>Successful as it undoubtedly was, the first American
season was full of trials&mdash;some small, one a near
tragedy. Mr. Tretbar (who, it should be recorded,
later became Paderewski&rsquo;s staunch friend and ally)
had indeed had little faith in the success of just one
more piano player from Europe. To Paderewski&rsquo;s
great annoyance he found that his six solo recitals to
be given the week after the three orchestral concerts
would not be played in Carnegie Hall, but in a small
recital room in Madison Square Garden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Why? I&rsquo;ve just filled Carnegie
Hall for you! Why should I play my recitals in
a small place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Tretbar shrugged. A solo piano recital would
never fill Carnegie Hall, he said. Besides, it was in the
contract that Mr. Paderewski would play where and
when he was told to play, and he was being told to
play in the small hall of Madison Square Garden!</p>
<p>He played three out of six recitals there. When
hundreds of would-be ticket-buyers were turned
away, disappointed, from the third one, Mr. Tretbar
had nothing whatever to say. Mr. Steinway himself
ordered the last three recitals moved to Carnegie
Hall.</p>
<p>Paderewski&rsquo;s brilliant concerts shed a special lustre
over the new hall which until then had simply been
one of several possible places to appear in New York
City. But soon a new artist&rsquo;s appearance in Carnegie
Hall came to be regarded as the real sign that he had
&ldquo;arrived.&rdquo; It was Paderewski&rsquo;s successes there that
established the trend more than any other single
factor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>Paderewski left New York with the audiences and
critics alike solidly behind him. His New York success
was repeated all over the country. Although he
was naturally delighted to play before packed houses,
the economic aspects of the tour were more and more
irritating. He was being paid an average of $375 for
each appearance, yet the box office income was running
upwards of $3,000! Far more serious was the
frightening problem that soon began to plague him.
As the strenuous weeks wore on, as solo recitals and
orchestral concerts piled up, the strain of playing so
often in public began to produce a violent physical
reaction in his right arm. Before long he found himself
playing in almost constant pain. The actual physical
basis of his trouble lay in the action of the Steinway
pianos of that day. As Paderewski said, they were
&ldquo;universally recognized as the most marvelous instruments
in the world.&rdquo; But they had an action that he
found extremely heavy and tiring. It simply took too
much pressure to move the keys. After much arguing
back and forth he finally persuaded the factory to regulate
the action of the seven pianos he was using for
the tour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>The relief was immense and the discomfort in his
arm, although still present, became bearable. Then
one dreadful night in Rochester, as he was playing the
opening chords of his recital, he felt an excruciating
pain tear through his right arm. (Afterwards, when
it was too late, he found out what had happened. The
piano used in the Rochester concert had just come
back from the factory, where a new and unbriefed
workman had carefully changed the action back to
its original stiffness.) Yet Paderewski stayed on the
platform to play the Beethoven &ldquo;Appassionata&rdquo; Sonata,
one of the most taxing works in the repertoire.
He finished the program in a state of near collapse,
then rushed off to find a doctor, and to hear the terrifying
truth. He had torn some tendons in his right
arm and could no longer move his fourth finger. The
doctor said, &ldquo;The situation is very grave, and there is
nothing that I can do for you. Nothing but time will
help. You must rest.&rdquo; This was easy advice to give,
but how does a pianist rest when he has concerts ahead
of him for which tickets have been sold? Paderewski
did it by rearranging the fingering in every piece of
music on his programs so that he could play with only
four of the fingers on his right hand. This is like asking
a baseball pitcher to fire a curve ball without using
his thumb!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>It was not the first time that Paderewski had demonstrated
the peculiar iron of his constitution. It was
certainly not the last.</p>
<p>At the end of the tour he returned to New York
exhausted and discouraged, but relieved that the
gruelling months were over. He was met by news
that both pleased and horrified him. Mr. Steinway, all
smiles, announced that various cities not included in
the tour were besieging the office with requests for
Paderewski! &ldquo;Now Paderewski,&rdquo; he said expansively,
&ldquo;you are going to give those extra concerts and we
will pay all expenses&mdash;everything. Every cent that is
taken in will be clear gain for you. That will be our
small contribution to reward you for what was, I am
sorry to say, badly managed at the beginning of your
tour.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Generosity of spirit was a factor that meant a great
deal to Paderewski, but although Mr. Steinway&rsquo;s
thoughtfulness touched him, he was aghast at the
thought of playing more concerts. He was also struck
by the sobering thought that since his career had probably
been wrecked forever by this tour, he might as
well make the most of it. He gave the concerts and
made more from the extra ones than he had made out
of all the others put together.</p>
<p>Paderewski&rsquo;s bleak conviction that the American
tour might be his last happily proved to be mistaken.
Actually it was only the first of twenty triumphant
tours during which he would play more than fifteen
hundred concerts for more than five million people.
Only one other person has ever equaled his success
at the box office&mdash;the beloved soprano, Amelita Galli-Curci.
The two artists still stand supreme as the
greatest money-makers in the musical history of
America.</p>
<p>During those American tours, Paderewski did
much more than make music and money. He also
made friends in high places&mdash;firm, devoted friends
who respected him for his great spirit as well as for
his fleet fingers. And he captured the imagination and
affection of the American public as no other artist
has ever done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>How to describe Paderewski&rsquo;s electrifying effect
on the public! Many people have tried. Arthur Loesser,
in his fascinating book, <span class="smaller">MEN, WOMEN AND
PIANOS</span>, does it as well as anyone. He says: &ldquo;The
most flaming pianistic glory in America&rsquo;s history
broke out when the Steinways first put forth Ignace
Paderewski in the autumn of 1891. He was indeed a
performer of very high ability, an artist of unusual
expressive power; yet that was only one element of
his peculiar appeal. His total personality was just
what, in the American idea, a concert pianist&rsquo;s ought
to be, if one were to marvel at him and respect him
at the same time. His chrysanthemum of pale red hair,
the feminine dreaminess and brooding of his looks
coupled with his aggressive, solid muscularity&mdash;all this
was strange and might have seemed ridiculous to Philistines.
But the reserve of his bearing, the hypnotic
deliberateness and lordly courtesy of his movements,
were the signs of a profound inner dignity before
which a measure of awe could not fail to be felt. He
seemed, verily, the prince of a foreign realm. No
pianist has ever captured the American imagination
as he did, keeping his hold over it for thirty years. He
became a legend: his mispronounced name drew
farmers from their barns, schoolboys from their baseball,
real estate speculators from their offices&mdash;all manner
of unlikely persons from their dens&mdash;into a concert
hall to have a look and a listen at him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>The day would come when Paderewski&rsquo;s hold over
the affection of the American public would mean
more to him&mdash;and to his country&mdash;than he could even
begin to imagine as he sailed back to Europe at the
end of his first visit to America.</p>

<div class="img">

</div>
<p>The money he had made in America was important
to him for one reason: Alfred. At last he was able to
afford the kind of country holiday he felt would be
best for the boy&rsquo;s health. Father and son spent a few
wonderful months together in northern France. To
his great joy, both his sister, Antonina, and Edward
Kerntopf came from Poland for a visit. Antonina
brought with her the love and blessings of their father,
Jan Paderewski, who was too ill to travel, but the sister
could report at first hand how his great pride in
his son had illumined the good man&rsquo;s last years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>While Paderewski gave his sore arm a chance to
recuperate, he devoted himself to composing. He began
work on an opera called &ldquo;Manru,&rdquo; a folk story of
the gypsies who lived in the Tatra Mountains of
which he had such happy memories.</p>
<p>His return to the stage was delayed for over a year,
for the injured arm was not responding well to the
treatments of the numerous doctors who worked on
it. The combination of time and a gifted Parisian masseur
finally restored the use of his fourth finger, but
it never, he felt, regained its original strength.</p>
<p>It was the last year off he would have for some time.
During the next decade his spiraling career would
carry him at dizzying speed over thousands of miles
on five continents. In America, at least, he quickly
found a way around the tyranny of train schedules
and hotel reservations. He rented his own private
Pullman car. In it, together with his secretary, chef
and piano tuner, he traveled all over America. The
Pullman car was the home where he lived, ate, slept,
and practiced during his tours. Although it cost him
the equivalent of twenty-five first class fares, it was
well worth it. It was, in fact, the reason why his tours
could include so many out-of-the-way places and
why so many people had a chance to hear him. But
the principal advantage to railroad living was the fact
that at last he could practice as loud, as long, and as
late as he wished!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>This was the golden age of American railroading.
What rare, romantic moments were added to its history
by the roving pianist! All over the country the
same sort of scene repeated itself: a lone Pullman car,
sitting at night on a siding&mdash;waiting, perhaps, to be
coupled to the next express train going through Boston,
or Chicago, or San Francisco; railroad workers,
and even passing hobos, silently gathered around it
listening to the glorious sounds of music that poured
out across the almost deserted railyard.</p>
<p>Music was not the only thing that came out of that
famous car. The hobo population, with its rapid communication
system, soon spread the word that the
Paderewski car was always good for a free meal.
When Mr. Cooper, the magnificent but temperamental
chef, finally put his foot down, Paderewski
instructed his secretary to have fifty-cent pieces ready
for the men instead of food.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Not everyone would find it possible to live happily
in a Pullman car. But Paderewski had a happy combination
of physical and mental gifts that made this
life seem quite pleasant. He slept without any difficulty,
putting worries aside and falling into a sound
sleep as soon as he went to bed. His bedtime, to be
sure, was rather erratic on concert nights. Whenever
he played he worked himself up to such a frenzy of
excitement that it took him hours to &ldquo;unwind.&rdquo; But
he had two unfailing methods of relaxation&mdash;billiards
and bridge. He was fiendishly expert at both.</p>
<p>Paderewski&rsquo;s generosity&mdash;whether to whole audiences
or to individuals&mdash;was boundless. Many railroad
companies ran special Paderewski excursion trains
from the country into the cities where he was playing.
If one of these trains was delayed by bad weather,
Paderewski would simply wait for its arrival or would
add an extra hour of music at the end of the recital for
the benefit of disappointed late-comers.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>As for his generosity to individuals&mdash;it was the despair
of poor Goerlitz, who tried hard to set some limit
to his employer&rsquo;s open-handedness in money matters!
There was no point at all, Goerlitz knew, in even trying
to reason with him if the people asking his help
were Polish. In such cases, he was hopeless. But the
secretary often wished that he would not be quite so
generous about matters that were strictly business.
Like fees! There was that incident in California, for
example....</p>
<p>A young engineering student named Herbert
Hoover was working his way through Stanford University
by a variety of methods. First he organized a
laundry pick-up and delivery service. Then, with another
student for a partner, he opened a lecture and
concert bureau. The amateur managers had not done
well with their last attraction&mdash;a speech by William
Jennings Bryan&mdash;and they hoped to recoup with their
big spring attraction, Paderewski. But the concert
business is filled with pitfalls for the unwary, as the
young men were about to learn. Paderewski&rsquo;s fee was
high for those days&mdash;$2,000. Therefore the price of
the tickets was high&mdash;higher than the residents of San
Jose and environs were used to paying. The managers
had also failed to notice that the date selected for their
concert was in Holy Week, which cut down attendance
still further. Their Paderewski concert turned
out to be an artistic triumph&mdash;but a financial disaster.
When the last word was in from the box office, the
poor impresarios found themselves somewhat short of
their expenses. It was a solemn moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>The two students held a hasty conference. The first
obligation, of course, was to pay the artist. The local
people to whom they owed money for the rental of
the hall, the advertising, the printing, and all the rest,
would probably accept i.o.u.&rsquo;s until they could find
a way to pay their debts. Fortunately for the two students,
word of this leaked out to Paderewski. He took
quite a different view of the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Add up all the expenses of presenting this concert,
down to the last penny,&rdquo; he told the young men.
&ldquo;Then subtract it from the box office receipts. Whatever
you have left is enough for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mr. Paderewski&mdash;that will leave you $400
short of your fee! Let us give you a note and pay it
back as soon as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no.&rdquo; He waved aside the suggestion good-naturedly.
&ldquo;It is enough. After all, if I did not <i>earn</i>
my fee for you, why should you pay it to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the sort of fuzzy remark that nearly drove
poor Goerlitz out of his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that some day there&rsquo;ll be something I can
do for you!&rdquo; young Hoover said, as managers and artist
shook hands. But he felt slightly foolish as soon as
he said it. It was unlikely that a poor engineering student
would ever be able to do anything for the most
famous concert artist in the world.</p>
<p>It is possible for a person to be blessed with generosity
and yet be a little short on patience. Since Paderewski
had both virtues to an amazing degree, he
gave his time as easily as he gave his money, and of the
two commodities, time is often more valuable. Although
it often bored him to the point of stupefaction,
he was unfailingly polite about hearing young pianists
play. A night in Kansas City was typical. Paderewski
had played a tremendous recital before an enormous
audience&mdash;nearly seventeen thousand people. After
the performance, as he greeted his friends and admirers
backstage, he recognized a lady whom he knew
as a former Leschetizky pupil. Her name was Mrs.
White. A serious-looking boy of about twelve or
thirteen was standing with her as she waited for the
crowd to disperse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>After mutual greetings she came straight to the
point. &ldquo;Mr. Paderewski, this boy is one of my prize
pupils. Right now he&rsquo;s working on the Minuet. And
he&rsquo;s having some difficulty with the turn.&rdquo; Paderewski
smiled. Ah the Minuet! The Paderewski Minuet in G!
How many youngsters all over the world were
&ldquo;working&rdquo; on the Minuet! And most of them were
having trouble with the turn.</p>
<p>Paderewski looked at the boy. &ldquo;Sit down at the
piano, young man!&rdquo; he said sternly, his eyes twinkling.</p>
<p>(&ldquo;He scared me half to death!&rdquo; the student, glancing
back over that evening from a vantage point of
sixty years, would say.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<div class="img" id="pic7">
<img src="images/p15.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="560" />
<p class="caption"><i>Paderewski married Mme. Gorska.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The boy sat down and played the Minuet. When
he got to the problematic turn, the composer stopped
him and gave him careful instructions in the exact
fingering necessary to bring it off properly. When the
master-class was over, he shook hands and wished the
lad success in his musical career. The boy went home
in a glow of inspiration and for days worked at the
piano even harder than usual. (He was already in the
habit of getting up at 5 <span class="smaller">A.M.</span> in order to practice two
hours before going to school.) A few years later,
however, the eager young piano student suddenly decided
that piano playing was not for big boys. He gave
up his idea of a career in music and went on to other
things, including the White House. His name was
Harry S Truman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>On the night of their meeting, of course, neither
Paderewski nor the boy had any way of knowing that
on a night in Kansas City the future President of
Poland had just given a piano lesson to the future
President of the United States.</p>
<p class="tb">It was not until the year 1899, with a widespread
reputation firmly established, that Paderewski accepted
an invitation to play a series of concerts in Russia.
He had not been back there since the youthful
venture twenty years earlier, from which his father&rsquo;s
dream had so literally rescued him. On the way to
Russia, he played three concerts in Warsaw, returning
to his boyhood home where he was received with
every kind of honor. It was not so when he arrived in
Russia. While audiences everywhere were enthusiastic,
Paderewski felt keenly the strong hostility of the
conservatories of both Moscow and St. Petersburg.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>The real problem lay in the hatred many Russians
held for anything Polish. As a Pole, Paderewski felt
many slights, heard many unfriendly remarks and
even open hissing during his tour. He was not sorry
when it was over.</p>
<p>Soon after his return from Russia, Paderewski married
the beautiful Mme. Gorska with whom he had
fallen in love during the years that she had done her
best to act as a mother for Alfred. With his son and
his new wife he settled down for a rest on the beautiful
estate, Riond-Bosson, on Lake Geneva in Switzerland.
He had bought the villa so that Alfred could
have the quiet, open-air surroundings prescribed for
him. Paderewski was happier than he had been for
years.</p>
<p>Riond-Bosson also gave Mme. Paderewska an opportunity
to indulge one of her favorite hobbies:
poultry farming. The chicken houses as well as the
fruit trees of the place became famous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>The grapes of Riond-Bosson were of surpassing
sweetness and juiciness. One of their greatest admirers
in later years was Paderewski&rsquo;s devoted friend, Achille
Ratti, the papal nuncio in Poland. Paderewski always
made it a point to supply him with the first growth of
these luscious grapes. Even when the papal diplomat
took up permanent residence in Rome and could no
longer visit at Riond-Bosson, he received his grapes.
Border officials sometimes balked at passing the fruit
through the customs, but what could a mere customs
officer do when told that the grapes were a gift from
the beloved Paderewski to his friend, Pope Pius XI.</p>
<p>And when Paderewski went on tour, his wife was
his constant companion, remaining in the dressing
room while he played and doing everything in her
power to shield him from the prickly harassments of
concert work.</p>
<p>The great happiness that came to him at his marriage
was followed very shortly by a great but not
unexpected sorrow. Paderewski, while playing in
Spain, was called home by the news that Alfred had
died. A lifetime of care, of watchful attention and
special treatments had not been able to save him. At
twenty, he was buried in the Cemetery of Montmorency
in Paris, near the tomb of Chopin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>For Paderewski, work had always been the surest
antidote for grief. He now turned all of his energy to
the finishing details of his opera, &ldquo;Manru,&rdquo; which was
to be produced at the Dresden Opera in May, 1901.
Eight years of work lay behind the premiere of
&ldquo;Manru,&rdquo; which was shortly thereafter performed in
many of the leading opera houses of Europe. The following
winter the Metropolitan Opera in New York
presented it with an all-star cast and included it in five
cities of its annual tour. While the opera had, generally,
a friendly reception, one critic remarked sourly,
&ldquo;What a pity that Paderewski is now composing, for
he is no more a great pianist.&rdquo; He stood firmly alone
in his opinion.</p>
<p>Paderewski had been the favorite pianist of Europe
and North and South America long enough for the
news of his greatness to spread clear around the world.
In the spring of 1904 he set out on a tour of Australia.
On this trip Paderewski&rsquo;s baggage problem was complicated
beyond memory. The Paderewski menage
was enlarged by the addition of some forty parrots.
Mme. Paderewska had a fondness for all types of
birds, and the talking variety fascinated her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>One of these animals became a special favorite of
Paderewski&rsquo;s. Named Cockey Roberts, he was, according
to his master, &ldquo;more than a parrot. He was a
real artist in his way.&rdquo; Paderewski&rsquo;s particular delight
was Cockey Roberts&rsquo; habit of perching on his foot
during practice sessions. &ldquo;He would sit perfectly
still,&rdquo; Paderewski recalled, &ldquo;and then from time to
time, he would say in a very loving and scratchy
voice, &lsquo;Oh! Lord, how beautiful!&rsquo; It was touching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very few pianists ever retire from public performance,
even briefly, at the height of their careers. Paderewski,
however, did so in 1906. From causes he
describes as partly physical and partly psychological,
he had begun to feel a curious but very real aversion
to the piano. Not even the estate in Switzerland,
where he could let the sometimes healing forces of
farming work on his nerves, helped much. When, in
order to earn some money, he returned to concerts for
a time, he found the distaste for the piano still strong.
Physicians tried their arts on him, one even resorting
to hypnosis. By 1909 Paderewski said, &ldquo;The easiest
pieces in my repertoire I could not manage. The touch
was strange to me. It was torture.&rdquo; Perhaps Paderewski&rsquo;s
sudden distaste for his lifelong routine came
about because he was beginning to prepare himself
subconsciously for a new and wholly unexpected
career.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>In 1910 an event occurred that was both important
in itself and of great significance for the future. 1910
was a year of doubly historic moment in the history of
Poland. It was the centenary of the birth of Chopin.
It was also the 500th anniversary of the Battle of
Gr&uuml;nwald, in which a victorious Polish army had
driven out a foreign invader. Paderewski had never
once during the past forty years forgotten that a small
boy of ten had vowed to build a great memorial in
honor of that battle for Polish freedom.</p>
<p>He had commissioned a talented Polish sculptor to
design such a monument, and on the 500th anniversary
of the battle it was unveiled and presented to the
city of Cracow. On the base of it were carved these
words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For the glory of our ancestors and
the encouragement of our brothers.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the donor of the new monument, Paderewski
made a presentation speech which was marked with
the deepest patriotic fervor. Though he spoke quietly,
the Cracow speech strongly showed Paderewski&rsquo;s
deep knowledge of political affairs. And at a reception
in his honor, after the formal presentation, the voice
of the pianist was heard in a piece of peculiarly accurate
political prophecy:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;Brothers, the hour of our freedom is about to
strike. Within five years a fratricidal war will soak
with blood the whole earth. Prepare, compatriots
mine, brother Poles, prepare, because from the ashes
of burned and devastated cities, villages, houses, and
from the dust of this tortured soil will rise the Polish
Phoenix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was during these days at Cracow that those in
charge of the Chopin centenary asked Paderewski to
be present at Lwow for the ceremonies there. At that
time, also, his symphony was to be heard for the first
time in the country whose story is enclosed in its
measures. For the symphony&rsquo;s first movement is entitled
&ldquo;<i>In Memoriam</i>.&rdquo; Its second, a song of hope, is
called &ldquo;<i>Sursum Corda</i>,&rdquo; and the finale is a symphonic
poem based on heroic Polish melodies. At Lwow, the
composer and the orator spoke with equal eloquence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Paderewski&rsquo;s voice rang with determined courage
as he recalled Poland&rsquo;s glorious history, even under
long oppression. His words closed with a promise of
triumph as powerful as the final pages of the symphony,
as he said, &ldquo;Let us brace our hearts to fresh
endurance, let us adjust our minds to action, energetic,
righteous; let us uplift our consciousness by
faith invisible; for the nation cannot perish which has
a soul so great and immortal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the oppressor hear, I do not fear him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small wonder that the Russian police, when the
symphony was played in Warsaw the following year,
forbade the printing of any program notes referring
to the significance of its themes. But by that time
every Pole had heard Paderewski&rsquo;s words and knew
the meaning of his music.</p>

<p>All summer long the lovely town of Morges had its
share of the Swiss tourist business, but no date in the
year meant more to the hotel keepers, bakers, florists
and other local businessmen than July 31. It was the
happiest town holiday of the year. July 31 is the feast
of the great St. Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Society
of Jesus. It was, therefore, Ignace Paderewski&rsquo;s
feast day. Paderewski had a great devotion to his noble
patron, and St. Ignatius&rsquo; day was the occasion on
which friends from all over the world gathered at
Riond-Bosson to celebrate with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>As the years passed, the Paderewski feast day parties
became famous as the most brilliant gatherings in
Europe, for among the guests were the world&rsquo;s most
talented and witty people. Great care was expended
on these festive occasions not only on the refreshments,
which were superb, but on the entertainment,
which was unique!</p>
<p>The celebration of July 31, 1914, was as lovingly
and carefully planned as all the others, but a cloud of
apprehension hung over the day. One month had
passed since the assassination of the Austrian Archduke,
Franz Ferdinand. This act of violence had triggered
the chain of events that would lead to the catastrophe
of world war. An uneasy peace was still in
effect, but no one could guess how long it would last.
After Mass, the day, usually devoted exclusively to
fun, was punctuated by closed-door conferences with
military and diplomatic leaders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>But when the time came for the evening&rsquo;s festivities,
everyone tried to relax and forget the troubles of
the world, if only for a few hours. The dinner was
one of Antonina&rsquo;s and the chef&rsquo;s greatest triumphs.
The decorations&mdash;this year everything was ultra-Chinese&mdash;were
a delight. The dancing was especially
amusing because of the newly-imported American
ragtime. The &ldquo;ragging&rdquo; music was provided by eight
hands on two pianos. The hands belonged to Olga
Samaroff, Josef Hofman, Ernest Schelling, and Rudolf
Ganz. As for the entertainment! Schelling, who
was Paderewski&rsquo;s favorite pupil, was its mastermind.
At midnight he summoned the guests to the drawing
room, where chairs had been set up for the performance.
Tonight, the guests were told, they were in for
an unprecedented treat&mdash;a world premiere! They
were to hear the first performance of &ldquo;a symphony by
Schoenberg!&rdquo; Arnold Schoenberg was the leading
composer of a type of new music that was understood
by very few people, and Paderewski was known to
turn a particularly deaf ear in its direction. Hence the
delighted laughter and applause when the audience
heard that a &ldquo;Schoenberg Symphony&rdquo; had mysteriously
turned up in manuscript at Riond-Bosson. Paderewski,
for whom the entertainment was always a
jealously guarded surprise, threw up his hands in
mock horror.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<div class="img" id="pic8">

<p class="caption"><i>Riond-Bosson</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>To perform the new &ldquo;symphony,&rdquo; Schelling and
his fellow members of the &ldquo;orchestra&rdquo; had raided the
kitchen and the rest of the estate for every noise-making
instrument they could lay hands on: pots and
pans, cups and saucers, eggbeaters and typewriters,
hoses and horseshoes. With Schelling&rsquo;s frenzied conducting
to urge them on, the musicians turned in a
truly superb performance. At the climax of the work,
pots, pans, dishes, garden tools, everything went hurtling
into a large rain barrel, with a crash that could
probably be heard across Lake Geneva. Overcome by
the beauty of it all, the exhausted conductor himself
plunged head first into the barrel.</p>
<p>As the last echo of golden sound died away, as the
audience gathered its collective breath to unleash a
chorus of &ldquo;bravo&rsquo;s,&rdquo; the telephone rang.</p>
<p>The telephone had been ringing all day, bringing
greetings from missing friends. Why, then, was there
so ominous a quality in the sound of it now? Paderewski
was summoned by the butler and disappeared up
the short flight of steps that led from the drawing
room. A few minutes later he appeared at the top
step and looked down at the guests who were now
conversing in tense whispers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;the war is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The war had come, as inevitably it would. The cost
of the next four years in human life and human misery
was something so dreadful that few people could even
begin to imagine it. How ironic, thought Paderewski,
that in the cataclysm of war would be found the
means of freeing Poland from a century and a half of
bondage. &ldquo;We have known it would come,&rdquo; he told
the men who gathered in his study at dawn on August
1, &ldquo;yet we are not prepared. The gigantic armies
of Germany and Russia will clash on this helpless
body!&rdquo; He pointed a finger at the map of Poland
that lay on the table before him. &ldquo;But while Poland&rsquo;s
jailers attack each other, their captive will escape!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet he shuddered at the thought of what would
happen to his country in the immediate future. The
geographical location of Poland made it an absolute
certainty that the full impact of war would fall upon
the defenseless country. The armies of Poland&rsquo;s three
masters would ravage the land and strip it bare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Politically, too, the situation immediately became
dangerous so far as Poland&rsquo;s future was concerned.
Within two weeks after the beginning of the war, the
Czar of Russia issued a proclamation offering freedom
and love to his beloved Poles! &ldquo;The time has come
when the dream of your fathers and forefathers will
at length be realized!... Under the [Russian] sceptre
Poland will come together, free in faith, in language,
and in self-government!... With open heart,
with hand fraternally outstretched, great Russia
comes to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paderewski and his fellow-Poles could hardly keep
from laughing a very bitter laugh indeed at this sudden
change of heart on the part of Russia, for Russia
had until then emphatically denied that there was such
a country as Poland. It couldn&rsquo;t be, could it, that the
Russians were hoping to line up Polish support against
Germany and Austria, by dangling the hope of freedom
before the Poles? The worst of this hollow offer
was the fact that Russia was one of the allies of England
and France. When the question of a free Poland
finally came up, might the allies not be unwilling to
act against one of themselves? Might they not say,
&ldquo;The question of Polish freedom is settled. Russia will
take care of it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>These problems and hundreds of others were all on
Paderewski&rsquo;s mind during the next hectic weeks at
Riond-Bosson, as he contemplated his country&rsquo;s future&mdash;and
his own. Paderewski had already made himself
a career rich enough and rewarding enough to fill
the life of any one man. Now he was standing on the
brink of a second career&mdash;a greater one, he believed.
&ldquo;My country before everything else,&rdquo; he had said so
many times. &ldquo;After that&mdash;art!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The group at Riond-Bosson realized that the first
thing they had to do was to organize a relief committee
for the Polish victims of war. They asked the
great Polish writer, Henry Sienkiewicz, author of
<i>Quo Vadis</i>, to manage its affairs in Switzerland. The
Paderewskis themselves then prepared to leave their
home and go to Paris and London. Antonina was left
in charge of Riond-Bosson, which overnight had become
a refugee shelter.</p>
<p>In Paris, Paderewski conferred with his countryman,
Roman Dmowski, who was attempting to organize
some sort of national committee to represent Poland
before the other nations of the world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>In London he renewed old acquaintances, social and
political. A peppery little Welshman named Lloyd
George was Prime Minister. He thought the idea of
a free, restored Poland one of the most ridiculous ideas
he had ever heard. Others did not. Paderewski&rsquo;s
friends from happier days now rallied around him to
help with Polish relief work, even though England
herself was beginning to feel the economic hardships
of war. A Polish Relief Committee was formed and
within four months had raised a quarter of a million
dollars for relief. At its head was Miss Laurence Alma-Tadema,
who had admired Paderewski since the long
past day when she had first seen him posing for his
portrait in her father&rsquo;s studio.</p>
<p>With affairs in Switzerland, Paris, and London
under control, Paderewski was now free to turn his
face towards the country that he firmly believed held
the key to Poland&rsquo;s future. In January of 1915, he
sailed for America.</p>
<p class="tb">When Paderewski returned to the United States in
January of 1915 he had two missions to accomplish.
The first was to raise money to feed the starving people
of Poland. No one thought there was anything
odd about the world-famous pianist devoting himself
to the cause of his suffering countrymen. It was the
sort of thing one expected of artists.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>The second part of his task was much more complex.
The war was only six months old. No one knew
how long it would last, but some day it would be over.
That much, at least, was certain. And when that day
came, statesmen from all over the world would sit
down in conference to draw the new boundary lines
of Europe. If the dream of a free Poland were ever to
become a reality, it would be then. But who among
these statesmen knew or cared anything about the fate
of a country that geographically had ceased to exist
one hundred years ago? At the moment they had
other things on their minds&mdash;such as winning a war.
And in neutral America, the chief concern of responsible
statesmen was the question of staying out of the
war.</p>
<p>In Washington, D.C., Robert Lansing, the United
States Secretary of State, and therefore the most important
man in the field of foreign policy, was surprised
one day when his secretary told him that the
pianist Paderewski had asked for an appointment. He
was even more surprised when the famous man arrived
in his office and began to talk, eloquently he
admitted, about the ideal of a united and independent
Poland.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>Secretary Lansing was a true diplomat. Although
the question of reuniting the former country of Poland
was about the last thing in the world he had time
to discuss, he listened courteously. His thoughts were
all negative. &ldquo;This man is way out of his depth. He&rsquo;s
a sentimental idealist. What does he know about the
cold, cut-throat facts of international politics? He&rsquo;s
trying to do something that&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As gently as he could, Lansing asked a few pointed
questions. Whom did Paderewski represent? The Polish
government? There was no Polish government.
The Polish people? But which ones? The German-Poles?
The Austrian-Poles? The Russian-Poles?
There was no such thing as a unified Polish people
whose ideas the statesmen of the world would respect
because of sheer force of numbers. As for the Poles
in America, Lansing pointed out, they were more
hopelessly divided than the Poles who actually lived
in the divided country! Paderewski was only too well
aware of this fact. He had often smiled over the old
joke that says, &ldquo;Put two Poles on a sofa and you have
a new political party!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>In the United States several Polish relief committees
were already in existence. Naturally each group was
trying its best to snare the famous pianist for its own
ranks. The minute his ship had landed, he had been
besieged by their representatives. He had walked by
the hour with them in Central Park, listening to each
man&rsquo;s arguments in favor of his own point of view.
He had committed himself to none of them.</p>
<p>The man who could actually bring off the task of
unifying the American Poles would have to be a political
genius, not a musical genius, Lansing thought. As
he studied the flying hair and romantically flowing
tie of his visitor, he decided that this was decidedly
not the man to do it.</p>
<p>During the next few weeks Paderewski became accustomed
to the faint smile with which government
officials greeted him. He knew so well what they were
thinking. &ldquo;What does a pianist know about international
affairs?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>As Paderewski prepared to cross the country and
begin his tour, he felt discouraged but not despondent.
The men he had seen in Washington were important
men, but they were not the ones who would really
count in the end. There was a man&mdash;exactly the right
man&mdash;whose support he needed, the &ldquo;providential
man&rdquo; for whom he prayed and waited. But he knew
that God would send him when it was time.</p>
<p class="tb">The city of San Francisco was holding a great exposition.
The committee had asked Paderewski to
play a concert for the occasion, since he had always
been San Francisco&rsquo;s favorite artist. When he replied
that he was in the country to speak for Polish relief,
not to play concerts, they willingly changed their
offer. He could talk, he could play, he could do anything
he liked. They in turn would guarantee him an
audience of thousands who would be glad to hear
whatever he had to say. It was a fine way to begin his
career as a speaker, Paderewski thought. But as the
day and finally the hour itself approached, he grew
more and more nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes me think I can persuade an audience?&rdquo;
he asked his wife. &ldquo;By playing&mdash;perhaps. But
by speaking! And in English! How do I know they
will even listen to me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Madame Paderewska&rsquo;s eyes did not stray an inch
from the sock she was knitting. She smiled patiently
and said for the tenth time that day, &ldquo;They will
listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Paderewski walked toward the stage of the
enormous auditorium that night, he longed for the
blissful assurance he had once had of knowing exactly
how every note was going to sound. He stepped
out from the wings&mdash;and then stopped in his tracks at
the breath-taking sight that greeted him.</p>
<p>The stage was bare except for the piano. Hanging
behind the piano was an enormous flag that had been
made only a day before. It covered the huge back wall
of the building from one side to the other, and from
ceiling to floor. A triumphant white eagle on a blood-red
field! The flag of Poland!</p>
<p>Paderewski&rsquo;s nervousness vanished. He felt a great
surge of confidence both for the present moment and
for the future. The audience was cheering wildly, but
as he walked to the front of the stage and bowed, a
deep silence settled over the hall.</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;I have to speak to you about a country
which is not yours, in a language which is not mine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<div class="img" id="pic9">

<p class="caption"><i>The flag of Poland!</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>It was the first of over three hundred speeches. It
was the opening of a journey that would carry him to
every state in the country. He would travel thousands
of miles to speak thousands of words. And with the
unerring instinct of an artist, he had begun with a
phrase that sent an electric shock through that first
audience and every future audience that heard it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>A country which is not yours</i>&mdash;&rdquo; Yet as Paderewski
traveled from city to city, from platform to platform,
more and more Americans began to sense a kinship
with the country that did not even appear on the
map. For the first time the bitter irony of the Polish
situation became clear to them. Here was a country
that had lost its freedom four years before America&rsquo;s
had been declared. Yet Poland had been one of the
first nations in the world to advance the beliefs on
which America had been founded. &ldquo;Already in the
fifteenth century a self-governing country, Poland
became, in 1573, a regular republic, with kings
elected. In 1430, consequently 259 years before the
habeas corpus of England ... Poland established her
famous law &lsquo;No man shall be detained unless legally
convicted.&rsquo; Our broad, liberal Constitution of 1791
preceded by 57 years the Constitution of Germany
and Austria, and by 114 years the so-called Constitution
of Russia. And all these momentous reforms
... were accomplished without revolution, without
any bloodshed, without the loss of one single human
life. Does it prove our dissensions? Does it prove our
anarchy? Does it prove our inability to govern ourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>In a language which is not mine</i>&mdash;&rdquo; Yet somehow
he had made it his. Audiences that had loved Paderewski
the pianist now realized that he was equally great
as an orator, although he spoke simply and without
dramatic gestures.</p>
<p>When he finished speaking, he would turn to the
piano and continue his plea for Poland in still another
language. He would play the music of Chopin, and
when the listeners finally left the hall, they knew that
they had lived through a unique emotional experience.</p>
<p>It was no wonder that money for Polish relief began
to pour in. Few people who heard Paderewski
say &ldquo;Give me seed for this trampled, wasted land,
bread for these starving!&rdquo; could resist the appeal.
Generous America took the forgotten Polish people
to its heart. By presidential decree a special &ldquo;Polish
Day&rdquo; was established, because in the eyes of America
&ldquo;Poland&rdquo; had become synonymous with &ldquo;Paderewski,&rdquo;
the beloved artist who had so enriched the
golden era of peace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>Although the first half of his mission had flourished
beyond his greatest hopes, Paderewski felt that so far
he had done very little about the second half. He had
talked to plenty of government officials and diplomats,
but they had little to offer beyond polite interest.
Not until he had been in the United States for a
year was he able to take the first sizable step. As he
had known it must, it came through the intervention
of one man, a man who was neither government official
nor diplomat. He was the man to whom Paderewski
would write, &ldquo;It has been the dream of my life to
find a providential man for my country. I am now
sure that I have not been dreaming vain dreams.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="img">

</div>
<p>Colonel Edward Mandell House, who had never
accepted a political office, was more powerful than
any man in Washington. He was the confidential adviser
of President Woodrow Wilson. &ldquo;His thoughts
and mine are one,&rdquo; Wilson said of House, whom he
regarded as the most unselfish, patriotic man he knew.
No one in the country had a greater understanding of
European affairs than House. &ldquo;A super-civilized person,&rdquo;
the French statesman, Clemenceau, said of him,
&ldquo;escaped from the wilds of Texas, who sees everything,
who understands everything ... a sifting, pondering
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>From the day he had left England, Paderewski had
known that he could not succeed unless he somehow
got to House and convinced him of the justice in Polish
claims. But Paderewski was not the only foreigner
in the country who wanted something from the Colonel.
House was under constant siege by representatives
of small countries who were hoping to gain
something by the peace settlement. Since America
was still neutral, House had to be careful in dealing
with these men or even in seeing them. This is why
Paderewski proceeded cautiously in his opening
moves toward the Colonel. The fact that House&rsquo;s
apartment was a three minute walk from Paderewski&rsquo;s
hotel was an added source of frustration. So
short a distance separated him from the man who
could do so much for him!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Then one day early in 1916, his prayers were suddenly
answered. Paderewski&rsquo;s discreet diplomacy had
born fruit in a typical way. A Paderewski friend had
wangled a letter of introduction from an Assistant
Secretary of Agriculture to Mr. Robert Wooley, director
of the U.S. Mint. Mr. Wooley was known to
be a close friend of Colonel House. One day he sent
word from Washington that he would be in New
York in two days and would try to arrange a meeting
between Paderewski and the Colonel. Paderewski was
learning his new role in a practical way. As many a
diplomat had done before and after him, he had gained
his objective through a friend of a friend of a friend
of the man he wanted to meet.</p>
<p>Mr. Wooley had sternly cautioned Paderewski
against over-optimism. So his heart sank when he was
greeted at the door by a radiant Madame Paderewska.
&ldquo;You are going to save Poland!&rdquo; she cried, her beautiful
eyes filled with tears. &ldquo;I know it!&rdquo; And as the two
men walked the few blocks to House&rsquo;s East Fifty-third
Street brownstone home, the practical man of
business wondered even more at the Polish pianist&rsquo;s
calm and complete faith in the events of the next few
minutes. Well, perhaps he was right, but Wooley was
inclined to doubt it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Colonel House had marked half an hour off his
tight schedule for his interview with Paderewski, so
the two men did not waste time on small talk. Paderewski
had been waiting a long time for this moment.
He was ready for it. Pacing up and down the
Colonel&rsquo;s library, he began to tell his story. Point by
point he built his arguments for Poland, with a mixture
of logic and eloquence that an experienced lawyer
might have envied.</p>
<p>The half hour flew by. Nervously Mr. Wooley
looked at his watch and then glanced at the Colonel.
&ldquo;Let him go on,&rdquo; House muttered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour passed and then another hour. Whatever
Colonel House&rsquo;s later appointments were, they were
cancelled. Never in his career of listening to people
who wanted something had he heard a man plead his
cause so irresistibly.</p>
<p>When he had made his last point, Paderewski
stopped and waited for the Colonel to speak. House&rsquo;s
part in the two hour conversation was limited to three
sentences, but they were the most beautiful words
Paderewski had ever heard. &ldquo;You have convinced
me,&rdquo; he said, rising and holding out his hand. &ldquo;I promise
you to help Poland if I can. And I believe I can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>It was the beginning of a profound friendship between
the two men, one so eloquent, and one so silent.
And with the Colonel completely won over to his
side, the door to the White House stood open to Paderewski
at last. By the summer of 1916 House felt
that the time had come to introduce the pianist to
President Wilson. He arranged to have the Paderewskis
invited to a diplomatic dinner at the White
House.</p>
<p>Woodrow Wilson was a scholar and a statesman.
He had been a college president before he went into
politics. Such a man, Paderewski believed, would understand
the justice of his cause.</p>
<p>There was great excitement after dinner that night
when guests saw the piano in the East Room being
opened. Was Paderewski really going to play? He
was, they were told, since the President had asked him
to do so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>Although President Wilson did not know a great
deal about music, it did not take any special knowledge
to get the message that the Polish artist was trying
to convey by means of Chopin&rsquo;s music. Paderewski
and Chopin had become partners in this enterprise,
and never had the two worked together so eloquently.
As Wilson and Paderewski talked briefly together
after the performance, the pianist felt that he had won
his country another powerful ally.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic10">
<img src="images/p20.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="409" />
<p class="caption"><i>Woodrow Wilson had won an ally.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>It worked both ways. Wilson, too, had won an ally.
1916 was an election year. Paderewski campaigned
actively for Wilson&rsquo;s reelection all during the fall.
Many Polish voters, following the lead of the Polish
clergy, were Republicans. Paderewski convinced
them that their country&rsquo;s first real hope in a hundred
years depended on a victory for Wilson. In the end
he delivered the large Polish vote almost one hundred
percent.</p>
<p>On the day before elections, when the campaigner
had expected to relax a little, came shattering news
from Europe. Germany had issued a proclamation
declaring that Poland was a free and independent nation.
The freedom and independence, of course, were
the affectionate gift of the German government. The
story behind the &ldquo;gift&rdquo; was actually a simple one.
Germany had previously shown no sign of any such
good will to the Polish people. Far from it. As soon
as the Russians had been driven out, the German and
Austrian leaders had gathered over a map of Poland
and had once more divided it up, this time in a two-way
split&mdash;one half for Germany, one half for Austria.
Now suddenly they were declaring the country reunited
and free! Why?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Paderewski knew why. It was not Polish freedom
the German leaders wanted. It was Polish manpower.
They were convinced that if they presented Poland
with independence, a million Polish volunteers would
gratefully flock to enlist in the German army and
could be used to fight the Russians in the East. The
other reason for the move was a more subtle danger.
If the Poles appeared to accept the offer and consented
to be taken under the loving wing of Germany, then
America and the Allies would lose interest in the cause
of Polish freedom. Poland herself would be regarded
as a friend of the enemy.</p>
<p>Paderewski saw through the trick easily. &ldquo;This
means only more suffering for my people,&rdquo; he told
House. &ldquo;It means that another army will be raised and
that there will be more killing and more devastation!&rdquo;
He realized that everything he had won during the
past few years was in danger of being destroyed in
one day. Unless he acted quickly. But what could he
do? Never before had he felt so cruelly his lack of
real authority. If only he were the official spokesman
for some truly representative Polish groups, so that
when he spoke a firm majority of Poles spoke with
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>There was only one thing to be said for the fact
that he had everything to lose: he could afford to take
a desperate gamble. Cable lines buzzed between New
York and Paris, Paris and Chicago, Chicago and New
York. Within a few hours a statement was issued and
flashed to every Allied country. The German offer
was rejected, flatly and permanently. The message
was signed by Paderewski and was approved by the
Paris Committee and by several groups in the United
States.</p>
<p>But what about the rest of his countrymen, Paderewski
wondered. What about the millions of poor
Poles who were not trained thinkers, who might not
see the worm in the shining German apple? Would
they support him, or would they demand the right to
seize their freedom no matter who offered it to them?</p>
<p>He soon had his answer. Every Polish society in
the country immediately voted to make Paderewski
its official representative. They gave him full power
of attorney to make decisions and to act for them in
all political matters. From then on, when he spoke he
was speaking with the voice of three million Polish-Americans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>Of everything that Paderewski had done, this was
the coup that really made its mark on official Washington.
&ldquo;The first direct evidence of his capacity as a
leader which impressed me,&rdquo; wrote an observer, &ldquo;was
his successful efforts to unite the jealous and bickering
Polish factions in the United States.... I am convinced
that Mr. Paderewski was the only Pole who
could have overcome this menace.... His entire
freedom from personal ambition made him the one
man about whom the Poles, regardless of factions, appeared
to be willing to rally. It was a great achievement,
a triumph of personality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man who wrote this was Robert Lansing, the
Secretary of State who had once smiled when an eccentric
piano player had tried to talk to him about
Poland.</p>
<p>The exhausting events of November 5 and 6 should
have provided quite enough excitement and tension
for any two days in a man&rsquo;s life. But they were only
one part of the affairs that occupied him during those
forty-eight hours. November 6, remember, was election
day!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Woodrow Wilson had gone to Shadow Lawn, his
summer house on the New Jersey shore, to wait for
the election returns in comparative peace. It was a
trying day for him, following a hard, bitter campaign.
It was a day on which he chose his visitors with care.
One of them was Paderewski.</p>
<p>In the quiet study at Shadow Lawn the two men
talked for nearly an hour. Wilson spoke of his idealist&rsquo;s
dreams of world peace and mutual trust between
nations. He listened attentively while Paderewski, in
turn, described his hopes for his own country. The
President asked searching, practical questions. How
could Poland survive without an outlet to the sea?
Paderewski and House had often discussed this point
over a map of Europe. He explained their ideas to the
President. When the interview was over, Wilson said
solemnly, &ldquo;My dear Paderewski, I can tell you that
Poland will be resurrected and will exist again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paderewski went home exhausted but intensely
happy. It had been quite a pair of days! He longed to
go to bed, but the election returns were coming in
faster and faster now and he could not settle down
for the night until he knew for certain that everything
was going as expected. He heard the then familiar&mdash;and
now extinct&mdash;cry for which all America had once
waited. &ldquo;Extra! Extra! Read all about it!&rdquo; But the rest
of the newsboy&rsquo;s cry was a catastrophe. &ldquo;Wilson defeated!
Hughes elected!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Wilson defeated? Wilson who had just promised
him his country&rsquo;s freedom? For two years he had
worked inch by inch in the direction of the words he
had heard only a few hours before. And now it meant
nothing.</p>
<p>It was a cruel night, unnecessarily cruel as it turned
out. By five the next morning the newspapers were
out with a somewhat different story. Wilson had not
been defeated. The Extra-hungry papers had simply
neglected to wait for the California votes to be
counted!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you that Poland will be resurrected and
will exist again,&rdquo; Wilson had said. And the promise
was still good.</p>

</div>
<p>Paderewski was playing a war relief benefit the next
afternoon. He had played so little except his Chopin
since his return to the United States that he was preparing
for the much-heralded Carnegie Hall recital
with even greater care than usual. It was Monday,
January 8, 1917.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>While he was practicing, a message came from
down the street that Colonel House would like to see
him. Very little else would have taken him away from
the piano at that moment, but he was soon in the Colonel&rsquo;s
study.</p>
<p>Colonel House came quickly to the point, as usual.
&ldquo;Next Thursday I am going to leave for Washington,
and I wish to have with me your memorandum on
Poland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What the Colonel meant was this: he had decided
that the time had come to present President Wilson
with a full-scale study of the Polish situation. What
he needed from Paderewski was a memorandum telling
exactly what he wanted for his country and how
he thought it should be accomplished. It was the sort
of document that half a dozen trained diplomats might
work over for three weeks!</p>
<p>Paderewski felt as though a large mallet had just
thumped him on the head. &ldquo;Thursday! But I have my
recital tomorrow! And besides, it is impossible to
prepare such a document without the necessary data,
and besides&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have that memorandum by Thursday
morning!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Paderewski had by this time learned one thing
about the Colonel. He might be a man of few words,
but he meant every one of them.</p>
<p>He walked back to his hotel slowly. At all costs,
he told himself, he must keep his wits about him and
not panic. During World War II there was a Seabee
slogan that would have appealed to Paderewski, had
he heard it. &ldquo;The difficult we do immediately. The
impossible takes a little longer.&rdquo; He himself operated
along these lines. This job was impossible. It would
take a while. He went up to his rooms and began practicing
for four hours.</p>
<p>The program of that Tuesday afternoon recital included
the Beethoven C minor piano sonata, Op. 111.
This is one of the most taxing of all the sonatas in the
kind of intellectual demands it makes on the performer.
In addition to the Beethoven he played the
Schumann &ldquo;Butterflies,&rdquo; one of his favorite recital
pieces, and his own piano sonata Op. 21. Shorter
works by Chopin, Liszt, Mendelssohn and his composer-friend
Stojowski completed the program. And
as usual in a Paderewski recital, the encores he played
so generously were almost as extensive as the printed
program.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>Next morning the critics were enthusiastic about
the pianist&rsquo;s &ldquo;bravura performance.&rdquo; They spoke of
the wild delight of the audience which agreed to go
home only after the lights in the hall had been turned
off. It was, in other words, &ldquo;a typical Paderewski recital
audience,&rdquo; wrote the man from the <i>Tribune</i>. In
it were &ldquo;men and women of society, musicians, and
many young persons, even boys and girls who will
grow up to tell their juniors about the time &lsquo;when I
heard Paderewski.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet neither the critic nor the boys and girls knew
what a fantastic scene they had just witnessed: Paderewski
locked in absolute concentration on Beethoven
and Schumann and the others, while the fate of
his country waited silently for him on his desk.</p>
<p>When the recital was finally over&mdash;and he did not
deprive the audience of so much as one bow&mdash;he went
home and ate dinner. Then he went to work on the
memorandum. Thirty-six hours later&mdash;at eight <span class="smaller">A.M.</span>
on Thursday morning&mdash;it was delivered to Colonel
House. Paderewski went to bed for the first time since
Monday night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>His fatigue seemed well worth it a week later when
the Colonel came back from Washington. &ldquo;The President
was very much pleased with your memorandum,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Now get ready. The first shot will be
fired very soon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On January 22 President Wilson addressed Congress
on &ldquo;Essential Terms of Peace in Europe.&rdquo; Paderewski,
who was touring in the South at the time,
picked up a newspaper the next day and read these
words: &ldquo;No peace can last or ought to last which does
not recognize and accept the principle that governments
derive all their just powers from the consent of
the governed, and that no right anywhere exists to
hand people about from sovereignty to sovereignty as
if they were property. I take it for granted ... that
statesmen everywhere are agreed that there should
be a united, independent, and autonomous Poland, and
that henceforth inviolable security of life and worship ...
should be guaranteed to all people who
have lived hitherto under the power of governments
devoted to a faith and purpose hostile to their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words swam before his eyes. For the first time,
the fate of Poland had been publicly mentioned as an
official concern of the United States government.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>On April 2, 1917, President Wilson came to an
anguished but inevitable decision. He called upon the
Congress to declare war against Germany. Full mobilization
of the country&rsquo;s manpower was immediately
begun. Two days later, Paderewski, addressing the
&ldquo;Union of Polish Falcons,&rdquo; the most important Polish-American
group, called for the formation of a
separate Polish army, to fight side by side with the
Allies. An independent Polish army, he felt, would
prove to the world as nothing else could that there was
truly a Polish nation waiting for its moment of rebirth.
After almost insurmountable difficulties, he finally
won his point, and the governments of France and the
United States allowed him to go ahead with his plans
for the formation of the army. Two training camps
for Polish volunteers were founded, and soon twenty-two
thousand Polish-Americans had enlisted in &ldquo;the
Army of Kosciuszko.&rdquo; For help in transporting so
large a number of men to Europe, Paderewski turned
to the Secretary of the Navy, Josephus Daniels. He,
in turn, knew just the man to assign to the Paderewski
case&mdash;a young Assistant Secretary named Franklin
Delano Roosevelt whose admiration for the pianist
dated from childhood. With Roosevelt&rsquo;s enthusiastic,
red-tape-cutting aid, Paderewski&rsquo;s volunteers were
quickly sent to Europe. There they joined with the
European Poles to form an army numbering nearly
one hundred thousand men, fighting under the banner
of the white eagle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>Statesmen who had once believed that Poles could
never be united were now confronted by the fact of
a hundred thousand men joined by a common oath.
&ldquo;I swear before Almighty God, One in Three, to be
faithful to my country Poland, one and indivisible,
and to be ready to give my life for the holy cause of
its unification and liberation. I swear to defend my
flag to the last drop of my blood, to observe military
discipline, to obey my leaders, and by my conduct to
maintain the honor of a Polish soldier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Polish army paid tribute to Paderewski in a
superb and moving way. His name was inscribed on
the membership list of each company. Every day at
roll call, when the name &ldquo;Ignace Jan Paderewski&rdquo;
was read, one hundred thousand voices shouted back,
&ldquo;Present!&rdquo; This honor had been paid to a soldier only
once before in history&mdash;to Napoleon. It had never
before been paid to a civilian.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>And then at last came the day on which the unselfish
labors of the last three years bore glorious fruit.
On January 8, 1918, as the war entered its last phase,
President Wilson spoke to Congress on the peace that
lay ahead. He offered a fourteen point program for
what he hoped could be a just and permanent settlement
of the world&rsquo;s disputes. The thirteenth of these
points was this: &ldquo;An independent Polish state should
be erected which should include the territories inhabited
by indisputably Polish populations, which
should be assured a free and secure access to the sea,
and whose political and economic independence and
territorial integrity should be guaranteed by international
covenant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Paderewski read the electric words, he realized
that they were taken almost verbatim from the memorandum
he had written for Colonel House after his
Carnegie Hall recital exactly one year before. Paderewski&rsquo;s
work in America had been crowned with
a success that not even he, full of faith as he was, could
have imagined.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>In Poland, news of the thirteenth point brought
life-saving hope to the hearts of the beleaguered Polish
people. On an entirely different level an earlier incident
had already kindled a new flame of courage in
the hearts of the people of Warsaw. It had happened
during the final rout of Russian troops by an advancing
German army. To gain time for their retreat, the
Russians blew up the Poniatowski Bridge that spanned
the river Vistula in the very heart of the city. The
devastating roar of dynamite smashed windows and
shook buildings for miles around. Even the solid
Zamek shuddered to its foundation stones. The blast
almost uprooted the statues in Palace Square. As the
powerful vibrations ripped past him, King Sigismund
tottered but stood firm. Yet even in their fright the
people who ran through the square seeking shelter
could not fail to understand his message. Soon the
magical words were flying through the city. &ldquo;<i>Sigismund
has shaken his sword!</i>&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>At last the signing of the Armistice on November
11, 1918, brought the long horror to an end: Paderewski&rsquo;s
work in the United States was over, the
greatest tour in his career a complete success. The
next step in his mission would have to be carried out
in Paris, where the statesmen of the world would soon
gather to write treaties and to rearrange the border-lines
of Europe.</p>
<p class="tb">In Arthur Balfour, the British Foreign Secretary,
Paderewski had a powerful friend. The experienced
statesman now gave him some strong advice. It was
essential, as Paderewski knew better than anyone else,
that Poland be represented at the Conference table.
But the Allies would never recognize a Polish government
unless they felt that it truly represented all factions
in Poland. At the moment most Allied leaders
leaned toward Dmowski&rsquo;s Polish Committee in Paris.
But others were asking, &ldquo;What about Pilsudski?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What, indeed, about Pilsudski! A hundred times a
day the name drifted across Paderewski&rsquo;s mind like
an ominous shadow.</p>
<p>J&oacute;zef Pilsudski, the soldier-hero of Poland, had
fought his country&rsquo;s enemies for years on home
ground. He had escaped from both Russian and German
prison camps to organize a Polish army and a
Polish underground. At the end of the war he had
marched triumphantly into Warsaw and been acclaimed
Chief of State. The government he had organized
was strongly socialist, almost communist in
character. It represented the left-wing factions in Poland,
just as Dmowski&rsquo;s Polish National Committee
represented the right-wing factions. Naturally the
peace negotiators would not do business with both
groups.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;Someone,&rdquo; Balfour said, &ldquo;must unite these factions.
Someone must go into Poland and persuade
Pilsudski to cooperate with Dmowski to form a government
that is truly representative of all Poles.&rdquo; Obviously
there was only one man in the world who
had any hope at all of accomplishing such an assignment.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day the British warship that had carried
the Paderewskis safely through the treacherous
mine-infested waters of the North Sea dropped anchor
in Danzig, Poland&rsquo;s ancient seaport.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>Danzig was in German territory and the Germans
were not in the least enthusiastic about welcoming
the man who was trying as hard as he could to relieve
them of their share of Polish land. In the city of
Poznan&#769; to which Paderewski proceeded from Danzig,
a procession of school children carrying Polish
flags was fired on by sniping Prussian soldiers. The
windows of Paderewski&rsquo;s hotel room were shattered
by flying bullets, while he himself calmly tied his
necktie. Street-fighting between Poles and Prussians
immediately broke out and lasted for three days.
&ldquo;There is no doubt,&rdquo; Paderewski wrote to Colonel
House, &ldquo;that the whole affair was organized by the
Germans in order to create new difficulties for the
Peace Conference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no amount of threats and terrorism could stop
the people of Poland from lining the railroad tracks
between Poznan&#769; and Warsaw to cheer and shout and
weep tears of joy while they waited in the snow to
catch a glimpse of the man whose name had shone
like a beacon of hope for four devastating years.</p>
<p>Paderewski reached Warsaw on New Year&rsquo;s Eve.
The ovation that he received from the jubilant city
was heart-warming, but it was not really significant.
Tens of thousands of people in Warsaw might be
parading the streets in his honor; but the success or
failure of his mission depended on one man alone. On
the first day of the hopeful New Year, Paderewski
presented himself at the Belvedere Palace for his first
meeting with Marshal J&oacute;zef Pilsudski.</p>

</div>
<p>If a modern &ldquo;electronic brain&rdquo; were fed data about
every statesman of the twentieth century and then
asked to pick out the two men most completely opposite
and uncongenial, it would without a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation settle on J&oacute;zef Pilsudski and Ignace Jan
Paderewski. Even before their meeting each man had
a fairly good idea of what the other man was like.
Now for the first time they could size each other up
in person.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Pilsudski, eying Paderewski&rsquo;s elegant clothes and
quietly assured manner, recalled that this man was
the darling of a capitalistic society in whose image he
would try to rebuild Poland. Paderewski, noting the
Marshal&rsquo;s rough, purposely shabby uniform, drooping
mustaches, and abrupt, nervous behavior, remembered
that this bold revolutionary had spent most of
his adult life in prison, or in hiding, or in working
under cover, always in the shadows of conspiracy.
He was the sort of man who would stop at nothing,
including murder, to gain his objective because he
firmly believed that if the end was good, then the
means were unimportant. Yet there was one point of
agreement between them, Paderewski reflected, and
surely it was a strong enough basis for cooperation.
Each man, in his own way, loved his country and
would gladly have given his life for her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>By the end of the exhausting interview Paderewski
had come to the conclusion that this was not enough.
Pilsudski remained absolutely unshaken in his refusal
to have anything to do with Dmowski&rsquo;s Committee.
Poland, he believed, belonged to the proletariat&mdash;the
working man&mdash;alone. He would not admit that any
other class of people had any right to be represented
in the new government. As to the question of Allied
recognition, he simply brushed it aside. He could
take care of Poland all by himself, he seemed to
imply.</p>
<p>It was a frustrating two hours.</p>
<p>The next day Paderewski left for Cracow, convinced
that his mission had failed. But at three
o&rsquo;clock on the morning after his arrival, he was
roused from sleep by a special messenger from Pilsudski.
The Marshal, he was informed, requested his immediate
return to Warsaw for further negotiations.</p>
<p>What could have happened, Paderewski thought,
to change Pilsudski&rsquo;s mind even to this small extent?</p>
<p>What had happened was this: on January 4, representatives
of the American Relief Administration
had arrived in Warsaw to study conditions and to
discuss terms with Pilsudski. The starving people of
Europe had good reason to be familiar with the heroic
work of the A.R.A. which had already saved
millions of lives during that cruel winter of armistice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>In charge of the mission to Warsaw was Vernon
Kellogg, gifted both as a scientist and an administrator.
Somehow he managed to get the point across to
the iron-willed Marshal that if he expected American
Relief supplies and money to feed and clothe the desperate
Polish people, he would have to find a way of
cooperating with Paderewski and the Paris Committee.
Faced with so practical a necessity, Pilsudski
capitulated and asked Paderewski to help him form a
representative government. Paderewski himself was
named Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Pilsudski remained &ldquo;Chief of State.&rdquo; It was a
rather all-inclusive title.</p>
<p>The Americans were as good as their word. Better,
in fact, because once they had reported back to their
chief in Paris about the ghastly conditions in Poland,
miles and miles of red tape were instantly cut in
order to rush in the first supplies. Within a few
weeks a life-giving stream of food, clothing, fuel, and
medical supplies were pouring steadily into the country.
Even Pilsudski was impressed. The A.R.A did its
best for all suffering countries. But there seemed to
be something special&mdash;almost personal&mdash;about its feeling
for Poland, even though there was not yet an
officially recognized Polish government. The pianist
was a nuisance, Pilsudski must have thought privately,
but he had his uses if his popularity made the
Americans so generous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>What Pilsudski did not know was that there was
indeed a personal attitude involved in the work of
the American Relief Administration for Poland. For
at the head of the organization was a man with a long
memory&mdash;a former Stanford University engineering
student who had once taken a flyer in the business
of staging concerts.</p>
<p>Paderewski had completely forgotten that he had
once saved a young man named Herbert Hoover
from great financial distress. But Herbert Hoover
had never forgotten it. The $400 debt that had meant
so much to the student and so little to the artist had
now been paid a thousandfold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>As Prime Minister of Poland, Paderewski moved
his household into the Zamek. Did he remember the
many times that the young music student had passed
the royal palace and prayed for the day when a Polish
leader would once more be in residence there? Perhaps.
But Paderewski was too busy to spend much
time reminiscing. The work of forming first a National
Council of a hundred men and then a coalition
cabinet of sixteen was incredibly difficult. In the
course of his former career he had grown accustomed
to long, hard work, but it was nothing compared to
this! Poles, as we have seen, were not the easiest
people in the world with whom to do business politically.
And complicating life almost beyond endurance
was Pilsudski. The Chief enjoyed long, drawn-out,
usually pointless conferences that accomplished
nothing except the complete exhaustion of the Prime
Minister. He enjoyed them most at two or three
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, preferably just after Paderewski
had finally managed to retire for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a smell of sulphur in the air whenever
that man walks into a room!&rdquo; Paderewski said, and
he looked forward with increasing eagerness to the
day when he could leave Warsaw for Paris and the
Conference. What a joy not to be in the same city
as J&oacute;zef Pilsudski!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p class="tb">If the full story of Paderewski&rsquo;s accomplishments
at the Paris Peace Conference were told in this book,
there would scarcely be room in it for anything else.
The work of the next three months was the climax
and the crowning achievement of his second career.</p>
<p>When Paderewski finally reached Paris, the Conference
was in its eleventh week. His unavoidable
delay in Poland, he quickly realized, had been a
costly one. Dmowski had done his best in presenting
the Polish claims. His five hour speech to the delegates
was acknowledged as a masterful and scholarly
treatise. But here was Dmowski himself to tell Paderewski
that the Polish questions were all but decided
and decided in the negative! Somehow nothing
was going according to plan. Hostility, open and hidden,
dogged his best efforts. &ldquo;There is nothing to be
done about it,&rdquo; he announced flatly. &ldquo;Everything is
settled.&rdquo; The opposition of Lloyd George to every
one of his points, for example, practically guaranteed
failure. What nation would go against the British
leader just because of a minor issue like Poland?</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Nothing was going according to plan.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>Poor Paderewski, weary from months of trying to
establish order in Pilsudski&rsquo;s peculiar brand of chaos,
now realized that he had a tremendous job of political
&ldquo;fence-mending&rdquo; to do in Paris. For the problem
was Dmowski himself. The small nations at the Conference&mdash;those
whose main business was asking rather
than dispensing favors&mdash;had to depend to an enormous
degree on influence. And influence was largely
a question of personality. In personality Dmowski
was sheer disaster. Not only did his cold and academic
manner do little to win him friends among the
delegates, but his terrible anti-Semitism won him
active enemies among Jewish and non-Jewish delegates
alike. And of all the delegates who hated
Dmowski, Lloyd George hated him the most. So
irked, in fact, was the fierce little Welshman that
Paderewski&rsquo;s arrival only succeeded in rousing him
to greater heights of anti-Polish feeling. &ldquo;After all,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;what can you expect from a country that
sends as its representative a pianist!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paderewski decided to start repairing the damage
at the very top. Immediately after his arrival he paid
a call on the powerful President of the Conference,
Georges Clemenceau&mdash;the &ldquo;tiger of France.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>The present &ldquo;tiger&rdquo; met the former &ldquo;lion&rdquo; with a
ghost of a twinkle in his stern eyes. &ldquo;Are you, by
chance,&rdquo; he asked solemnly, &ldquo;a cousin of the famous
pianist Paderewski?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paderewski, with equal solemnity, bowed and said,
&ldquo;I am the very man, Mr. President.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clemenceau sighed deeply. &ldquo;And you, the famous
artist, have become merely a Prime Minister!
What a comedown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men laughed as they shook hands
warmly. They were off to a good start.</p>
<p>It was not long before nearly every delegate to the
Conference&mdash;even Lloyd George&mdash;came to the conclusion
that the Polish question must definitely be
reconsidered before any final decision was made. Paderewski
quickly became one of the most admired
and therefore influential men in Paris. He was useful,
too, as it developed. President Wilson and Colonel
House sought his help in explaining some American
attitudes to the Europeans, while the European
delegates could always count on him to interpret
their feelings for the Americans. More than any
other man in Paris, Paderewski belonged both to the
old world and the new.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;He came to Paris,&rdquo; Colonel House later wrote,
&ldquo;in the minds of many as an incongruous figure,
whose place was on the concert stage, and not as one
to be reckoned with in the settlement of a torn and
distracted world. He left Paris, in the minds of his
colleagues, a statesman, an incomparable orator, a
linguist, and one who had the history of Europe better
in hand than any of his brilliant associates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the delegates, a smooth, professional orator,
summed it all up rather nicely after a particularly
wonderful speech by Paderewski. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he sighed
to a group of his colleagues, &ldquo;if we could play as
Paderewski speaks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gains that Paderewski eventually won for his
country were not all that he had hoped for, but they
were far greater gains than any other man in the
world could have made. They represented, as one
statesman put it, &ldquo;a triumph of personality.&rdquo; Matters
of boundaries, perhaps, left something to be desired,
but these were not the major issue. The establishment
of Poland as a nation, free and independent among
the nations of the world&mdash;this was the major issue,
and this was finally brought about on June 28, 1919,
when the Treaty of Versailles was at last presented to
the delegates for their signatures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<div class="img" id="pic13">

<p class="caption"><i>The Treaty of Versailles was signed.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;What M. Paderewski has done for Poland will
cause eternal gratitude,&rdquo; wrote Secretary of State,
Robert Lansing. &ldquo;... His career is one that deserves
to be remembered ... by every man to whom love
of country and loyalty to a great cause stand forth as
the noblest attributes of human character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, a roar of applause
and approval greeted Paderewski as he stepped
forward to sign the treaty for Poland. No other delegate
except those of the &ldquo;big four&rdquo; nations received
such an ovation. But Paderewski&rsquo;s ears were accustomed
to the sound of applause, and it was probably
the last thing in his mind as he signed. His whole life
had been directed toward this moment. He had
worked, he had prayed unceasingly for the new life
of his country. Now it was an accomplished fact,
acknowledged by the whole world, witnessed by a
stroke of his own pen.</p>
<p class="tb">Paderewski&rsquo;s career as a statesman was drawing to
an end. It lasted only six months longer, and the half
year was a bitter anti-climax. When the Paderewskis
returned to Warsaw they found the atmosphere unbearably
hostile. Now that Pilsudski had &ldquo;used&rdquo; his
rival to gain Allied support, he was determined to
get him out of the way as quickly as possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>Growing opposition of the meanest kind blocked
Paderewski&rsquo;s attempts to build an honorable, democratic
government for his country. Pilsudski had
little interest in democracy and no interest at all in
maintaining the peace. He yearned for the smell of
powder again, and he planned to strike for further
Polish gains by making war on Russia. But first he
must eliminate the peace-loving Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Political intrigue is a merciless game. Paderewski
found himself attacked through the two things he
loved most in the world: his faith and his wife. Anti-clerical
feeling ran high among the socialists of the
country. They used Paderewski&rsquo;s staunch and well-known
devotion to the Church to &ldquo;prove&rdquo; that he
was a &ldquo;tool&rdquo; of the clergy and was therefore, somehow,
dedicated to the enslavement of the working
man. It was a fantastic charge from start to finish, but
people believe what they want to believe, and disgruntled
elements in the Sejm&mdash;the Polish assembly&mdash;eagerly
spread the story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>Even more cruel were the charges leveled against
Mme. Paderewska, she who had worked herself almost
to the breaking point not only to ease her husband&rsquo;s
arduous life, but to further the cause of Polish
relief. She was accused of undue interference in matters
of state, of being a bad influence on the Prime
Minister, of any vindictive thing that could be
thought of to discredit her husband.</p>
<p>A man of Paderewski&rsquo;s moral courage can weather
almost any attack made against him, but the abuse of
his wife cut him to the heart. For weeks he wrestled
with his conscience. He was thinking, as usual, first
of Poland; last, of himself. If he stepped aside now,
would it not end the terrible dissensions that rocked
the newborn country? But if he did so, would he not
be deserting his country when she needed him, deserting
her, perhaps, out of a selfish, if natural, longing
for personal peace?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>At last, on December 5, 1919, Paderewski announced
his resignation from office. A few days earlier,
at a wildly agitated meeting of the Sejm, his government
had received a vote of confidence, but the
vote had been carried by a very slim majority. Too
slim a majority, Paderewski felt, to represent a true
mandate of the people, particularly since one of the
parties that voted against him in the Sejm actually
had more followers, numerically, than any of the
parties who voted in his favor. If he stayed on, nothing
could follow but further discord. If he left now,
then surely the country would somehow make her
way to internal peace and unity.</p>
<p>Paderewski generously agreed to the panic-stricken
request of the Sejm that he try to form a
new cabinet. Then he quietly left Warsaw, and after
five years of voluntary exile returned to his beloved
home on the shining Swiss lake.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/ceagle.jpg" alt="Coat of arms with Eagle." width="300" height="320" />
</div>
<p>An announcement the world had been hoping to
hear came from Paderewski on July 14&mdash;Bastille Day&mdash;1922.
As he boarded the <i>S.S. Savoie</i> in New York
for a trip back to Europe, he announced that in the
fall of that year he would return to the United States
to resume his concert career. He had not played in
public for five years, not since the night he played
in the Metropolitan Opera House at a special concert
in honor of the French hero, Marshal Joffre. But
now he was ready to move back to Carnegie Hall
and the other concert platforms of the world. Or at
least he would be ready, he felt, after four more
months of the kind of hard work he had been doing
behind closed doors for over two years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>Although certain of his friends advised against the
step, the fact of the matter was that Paderewski had
no choice. He had to return to the stage because it
was the only way he knew how to make a living. He
had to work for a living because he had no money.
He, who had been the richest artist appearing before
the public, was now all but penniless. Nearly all of
his great fortune had been given away to the war-hungry
people of Europe.</p>
<p>The announcement created a sensation. Paderewski
was returning to the stage! Newspaper editorials
around the world&mdash;and even his close friends and
staunchest admirers&mdash;asked the same question: would
his second concert career be a triumph or a failure?
Yet the answer should have been clear to anyone
who gave a moment&rsquo;s thought to Paderewski&rsquo;s life
and work. Clearly he would never have made the decision
to return to the scenes of his former greatness
if he had not been sure of his own powers and of his
ability to use them again as fully as before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>But never before had Paderewski spent more
painstaking hours on his beloved music than he did
in the months just before his second Carnegie Hall
debut. The great French violinist, Jacques Thibaud,
who crossed the Atlantic with him, said that Paderewski
even sacrificed his favorite pastime of
bridge in favor of extra hours of practicing.</p>
<p>It was thirty-one years, almost to the very day,
since his well-remembered debut in Carnegie Hall in
1891. Now, on November 22, 1922, he walked out
on the famous stage to begin again. This time an audience
that months before had bought every seat in
the house filled the hall with a great cheering at his
entrance, and kept up the applause until he seated
himself at the Steinway and struck the few chords
with which he always liked to quiet his listeners.
That he was nervous was certain. But that his fingers
had every ounce of the control, of the magic singing
sound, and the thundering excitement they had had
in the past was clear to him and to his audience. It
was clear, also, to the critics, who were unanimous
as they sought, almost desperately, to describe the
mature playing of this man who was now so much
more than a pianist.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>There was no dissent anywhere from the critical
opinions. But there was one special friend who,
under unique circumstances, summed it up better
than any other. He was Georges Clemenceau,
France&rsquo;s wartime premier.</p>
<p>On the night before his own return concert in
Carnegie Hall, Paderewski had gone to the Metropolitan
Opera House to hear Clemenceau speak. But
Clemenceau had to make another speech on November
22 and had not been able to hear the great triumph
of Paderewski&rsquo;s return. When Paderewski&rsquo;s
concert was over, he was driven to the home of
Charles Dana Gibson, a fashionable artist of the day,
with whom Clemenceau was staying. There, the two
men greeted each other with the deepest affection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>Paderewski said to Clemenceau, &ldquo;You are the
greatest man I ever knew. You told them the truth
in a splendid way of which you alone are capable.&rdquo;
He was referring to Clemenceau&rsquo;s speech at the Metropolitan
Opera, when the &ldquo;tiger of France&rdquo; had
called upon America to help Europe in the difficult
postwar days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, you are the greatest man,&rdquo; Clemenceau
replied. &ldquo;At the peace conference you made such a
wonderful speech that I was nearly moved to tears.&rdquo;
Then the old Frenchman paused. &ldquo;I missed your concert,&rdquo;
he said apologetically. &ldquo;When will you play
for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; Paderewski answered. &ldquo;I will do anything
for you. I will play for you now!&rdquo; And for
nearly an hour, the man who had only a short time
before played for three hours in Carnegie Hall
played in the half-light of the Gibson mansion.
When it was over, Clemenceau said, &ldquo;Marvelous,
marvelous. You are not only a great musician and a
great statesman, but a great poet also.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>From New York, Paderewski&rsquo;s tour led him across
America, as it had so many times in the past. His
private car again became a familiar sight on the railroad
tracks of the country. Again switchmen, brakemen,
and the freight handlers across the country
were treated to the glorious sounds that came from
this very special Pullman car. In Minneapolis, Paderewski
played an entire impromptu recital in the
car one day for ten nuns who could not attend his
regular concert. Sitting at his upright, with the noises
of switching cars and passing engines for background,
Paderewski played as if he were on the stage
of a great auditorium. And surely he had never had
a more appreciative audience.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s capitals, political and musical, saw
and heard Paderewski once more as he traveled from
Hawaii to London in the old, familiar crossing and
recrossing pattern. Honors came to him, more than
were ever given to any pianist before or since. Universities
vied with each other to give him honorary
degrees. One, from New York University, had to be
delivered to him in his hotel room when he was too
ill to leave it for the formal convocation. To the University&rsquo;s
Chancellor, Paderewski said, with a smile,
&ldquo;You have come to a sick man to make a doctor of
him!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Ignace Paderewski, 70 years of age</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>Paderewski easily recovered from a sudden appendectomy,
in the fall of 1929, and made one of the
longest of all his American tours the following year,
playing 87 concerts in the winter of 1930-31. The
death of his wife in January, 1934, was less upsetting
to Paderewski than some of his friends had feared it
might be, because for five years before she died,
Mme. Paderewska had suffered from a loss of memory
and her tragic illness had actually withdrawn
her from all the activities in which for over 35 years
she had played so busy a role.</p>
<p>On his tours, Paderewski played many benefits for
war veterans. In the years when the depression
spread across the U.S. and Europe, he was always
glad to play concerts whose proceeds went to unemployed
musicians. One of these, in Madison
Square Garden in 1932, raised nearly $50,000. And
in the midst of his renewed career, Paderewski kept
in intimate touch with the political development in
Poland and throughout Europe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>One of the greatest of his speeches was given in
May, 1932, at a banquet in his honor in New York
City. Broadcast across the entire country, Paderewski&rsquo;s
address that day was a magnificently outlined,
superbly delivered history and analysis of the so-called
Polish Corridor. His country&rsquo;s vital need for
an outlet to the Baltic Sea was at stake, and Poland&rsquo;s
position and rights were being threatened. The entire
speech was later published in <i>Foreign Affairs</i>. It
was built as a master symphony is built, with its
principal themes stated in varying manner during its
course, and its closing pages rising to a superb climax.
As he reached its final lines, Paderewski said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not wish to be crippled or enslaved again.
We will never accept so monstrous an injury, no
matter by whom inflicted. The territory restored to
us is justly ours. And we will stand by it with all our
strength and uphold it by all our means. For if that
restoration is wrong, then the partitions of Poland
were right&mdash;and nobody should expect us to subscribe
to such an iniquitous verdict....</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not want war. Everyone in Poland is
longing for peace. We need peace more than any
other country in the whole world. Nevertheless, if
a war&mdash;and I am speaking now not as an official person,
because I am not an official; I am a plain citizen,
and I assume my own responsibility&mdash;if a war, I repeat
it, by a formal declaration or by surprise is imposed
on us, we shall defend ourselves.&rdquo; Once again
Paderewski was speaking the language of prophecy,
though seven years still lay ahead before Poland
would once again be invaded, this time by the armies
of Hitler.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>The year 1936 brought a brand new career into a
life already crowned in two widely separated areas,
music and politics. On August 8, Paderewski, the
movie star, was born. For months, Paderewski&rsquo;s chief
aide had been working quietly, without Paderewski&rsquo;s
knowledge, to arrange the making of a movie
about Paderewski. Finally when negotiations with a
British company had reached a stage where Paderewski&rsquo;s
consent was necessary, the subject was brought
up and met with none of the resistance that had been
expected. Despite his lifelong dislike of bright lights,
especially while playing, Paderewski spent two weeks
on a movie lot outside of London making what is
really a weakly sentimental production entitled
&ldquo;Moonlight Sonata.&rdquo; Its one distinguishing feature is
the ennobling sight and sound of the great artist
moving through a few scenes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>The movie did have the effect of returning Paderewski
to at least semi-public playing for the first
time since the death of Mme. Paderewska, two years
before. Late in 1938, Paderewski agreed to a short
tour of England, where he played with ease and
vigor. Their surprise turned to genuine dismay, however,
a few weeks later when Paderewski announced
his return to the U.S. for the early spring of 1939.
The cold, undeniable fact was that Paderewski once
again needed money. He could only earn enough to
meet his obligations by returning to the United States
at the age of 79 to play again for the thousands who
clamored to hear him. He had never saved any
money for the days when he might need it for himself.
There had always seemed some better reason
for giving it away. Against this real need was Paderewski&rsquo;s
rapidly failing health. In her diary, a
friend said of him at this time, &ldquo;He looks so feeble
and moves about with such difficulty that I simply
don&rsquo;t see how he can contemplate a concert tour of
the U.S., of all places.... How on earth will the
President walk on the stage during his recitals?
Surely not with the support of his cane, which he
uses to get from room to room!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>

<p class="caption"><i>Studio 8-H of Radio City</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>He did come to the United States and played the
first concert of his 20th tour in that country in
Studio 8-<span class="smaller">H</span> of Radio City, before an invited audience
of several hundred and a radio audience that was estimated
at fifty million. Olin Downes said of Paderewski&rsquo;s
playing of the <i>Moonlight Sonata</i> on that
day, &ldquo;We had not heard him play this music with
such tonal beauty and poetical effect.&rdquo; The program
included Liszt and Chopin, and at the end, naturally,
<i>the</i> Minuet, of which the audience literally forced
an encore.</p>
<p>Several more concerts followed, each of them
packed to the rafters. Then came May 25, the day
of the final concert scheduled for Madison Square
Garden. It had been sold out for days, and as the
hands of the clock moved down to 8:30, more than
15,000 people full of a special expectancy waited for
the famous old man to appear. 8:35 came, and 8:40,
and still they waited. A little before 9 o&rsquo;clock, an announcement
came over the Garden&rsquo;s loudspeakers.
&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Paderewski has had a
slight heart attack in his dressing room, and his doctor
is moving him back to his private car.&rdquo; Slowly,
not quite believing what had happened, the crowd
quietly began to leave, many of them without any
thought of getting their money back, for already
someone had suggested that a fund in honor of Paderewski
could be started with the money that was
in the box office. Paderewski had played his last
concert.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>But still there was strength in the grand old lion.
And he would need every ounce of it. Five days after
his collapse, Paderewski was strong enough to sail
for France on the <i>Normandie</i>. After resting in Paris
for several weeks, he returned to his beloved Riond-Bosson.
On August 1, 1914, he had once stood and
said, &ldquo;My friends, the war is here.&rdquo; And here, on
September 1, 1939, twenty-five years and one month
later, the news came to him that the Nazi army, at
Hitler&rsquo;s orders, had invaded Poland. On that day Paderewski
broke his long-standing rule never to listen
to the radio. The only set in the villa was brought
down to the dining room where, throughout the day,
it poured out its tragic reports: Warsaw and many
other Polish cities being laid waste by German
bombs. His prophecy of a quarter of a century before
had come true all too soon!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>Now the blows came faster, with the fall of
France, and, in Paderewski&rsquo;s opinion, with the complete
failure of the machinery of the League of Nations
to function as his old friend, Woodrow Wilson,
had intended it to. &ldquo;Dishonorably discharged!&rdquo; was
Paderewski&rsquo;s final verdict against the League one
evening after a long, discouraging discussion.</p>
<p>In 1940 Paderewski was named President of the
National Council, which was the Polish government-in-exile.
Together with President Raczkiewicz and
General Sikorski, the three men were to operate
wherever and however they could to keep alive the
body and the spirit of Poland. But when France fell,
Paderewski felt that he could do more if he could
return to America. He was also sure that the United
States could not remain much longer outside the conflagration
that was sweeping across Europe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>In September Paderewski began his last (and what
was to prove by far his most hectic) trip. His friends
had been urging him for weeks to leave Switzerland
as soon as possible. Great as his personal prestige and
international reputation were, it was feared that, as
the living spirit of exiled Poland, his life might be
put in real danger at any moment. There were seven
passengers in the two cars that left Riond-Bosson on
September 23. One car was a Cadillac that Herbert
Hoover had given Paderewski in Warsaw. The other
one helped to carry the luggage of the party. At the
Swiss-French border they were joined by an agent
of the S&ucirc;ret&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, the political police. Monsieur
Garric had been assigned to the Paderewski party by
the French Government to assist them in their journey,
and he proved an invaluable addition before
they were out of France. Time after time when the
party was stopped for questions by various authorities,
M. Garric merely flipped his lapel, revealing his
badge, and the party continued on its way. And, of
course, the name of Paderewski had the greatest possible
effect. An official in the customs office at the
Spanish border began to whistle the Minuet when he
saw whose passports were passing over his desk.</p>
<p>Saragossa in Spain is the city that will go down in
history as the only place ever to put Paderewski in
prison. The President&rsquo;s entire party was placed under
house arrest, and the fact that they were allowed to
stay in their hotel did little to relieve the affront.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<div class="img" id="pic16">
<img src="images/p29.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="793" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;... <i>to remain until Poland is free</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>For five days, under a flimsy pretext of being concerned
for Paderewski&rsquo;s safety, the authorities of
Saragossa kept the seven unwilling visitors confined
to their hotel. Finally a cable from President Franklin
Roosevelt direct to Generalissimo Franco got
them out. No apology, no further explanation was
ever heard from Saragossa. But by October, after a
happy and reasonably relaxed trip through Portugal,
they all boarded the American Export liner <i>Excambion</i>,
and on November 6 they sailed into New
York harbor. It was Paderewski&rsquo;s 80th birthday.</p>
<p>The Americans, who had loved and admired Paderewski
for almost half a century, would have worn
him out with receptions and dinners in his honor.
But settling himself quietly in the Buckingham Hotel,
he spent his time and strength in talking and corresponding
with those who were most important to
the present and future welfare of Poland. In June he
asked to speak at a Polish war veterans&rsquo; rally in Oak
Ridge, New Jersey. The day was hot and the rally
itself was a steamy, exhausting affair. Paderewski
went home very tired and feeling as though he had
caught a cold. Within a week, on the 29th of June,
several hours after a priest had given him the sacrament
of Extreme Unction, Paderewski died.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>At his funeral in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral, with
nearly 5,000 crowded inside and 35,000 outside lining
Fifth Avenue and the adjacent streets, Cardinal,
then Archbishop, Spellman eulogized Paderewski,
saying &ldquo;his death steeps the entire civilized world in
mourning.&rdquo; And then the train took his body to
Washington where it lay in state in the Polish Embassy
until the following day.</p>
<p>The President of the United States had personally
arranged for Paderewski&rsquo;s burial in a way that offered
the greatest honor in the country&rsquo;s power. By
special order, the body was taken to Arlington Cemetery,
ordinarily reserved for American citizens who
have served in their country&rsquo;s armed forces. As Paderewski&rsquo;s
coffin, mounted on a military caisson, entered
the gates of Arlington, cannon fired a 19-gun
salute, the highest number possible to anyone not the
head of a state. Flanked by United States soldiers,
sailors, and marines, and joined by a squad of Polish
soldiers in Canadian uniform, the caisson moved to
the very center of the Cemetery. There, under the
mast of the battleship <i>Maine</i>, Paderewski&rsquo;s coffin was
placed in a vault &ldquo;to remain until Poland is free.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>The world is indebted to Paderewski in a very special
way. To it he brought a flaming vision of great
music-making. He placed before his listeners in singular
glory the music of Chopin, one of the greatest
composers of piano music the world has ever known.
He carried to corners of the earth some of the most
powerful pianism ever to be heard, never deviating
from his own highest standards of excellence. Then,
when his country&rsquo;s very existence was at stake, he
proved himself an equal or even, in the opinion of
some, a greater master in the arena of international
politics. His genius extended to the devious ways of
statecraft with the same penetration it had shown in
the mastering of music&rsquo;s subtlest arts. His ability to
influence men was as forceful when he spoke as it had
been when channeled through the keys of a Steinway
concert grand. He was unique in his lifetime.
Nor has he had a successor.</p>

<h3 id="c13">THE AUTHORS AND THEIR BOOK</h3>
<p><span class="sc">Ruth Fox Hume</span> <i>was born in New York City and attended
the College of New Rochelle. She attended medical
school briefly, where she discovered that she was
more interested in the history of medicine than in its
practice.</i> <i>The result was</i> Great Men of Medicine <i>(Random
House, 1947, revised, 1961) and</i> Milestones of Medicine
<i>(Random House, 1950). While she pursued her
writing career, she taught at Holy Cross Academy and
Catholic University.</i> <i>Some recent books include</i> Our
Lady Came to Fatima <i>(Farrar, Straus, and Cudahy,
1957),</i> Saint Margaret Mary <i>(Farrar, Straus, and Cudahy,
1958), and</i> Florence Nightingale <i>(Random House,
1959). Mrs. Hume also writes book reviews for the
Washington</i> Evening Star.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Paul Hume</span> <i>was born in Chicago and received a degree
in music from the University of Chicago. He became music
director of a &ldquo;good music&rdquo; radio station and then music
critic of the Washington</i> Post, <i>a position he has held for
sixteen years. He is a Professor of Music at Georgetown
University and has been the director of the Georgetown
Glee Club for twelve years. He is the author of</i> Catholic
Church Music <i>(Dodd, Mead and Co., 1956), as well as
many articles that have appeared in</i> The Saturday Review,
The Sign, The Catholic Digest, <i>and others</i>.</p>
<p>THE LION OF POLAND <i>is the first book on which
the Humes have collaborated. They live in Washington,
D.C., with their four children, Paul, Michael, Ann, and
Peter.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>THE LION OF POLAND <i>(Hawthorn, 1962) was
designed by Stefan Salter and completely manufactured
by American Book&mdash;Stratford Press, Inc. The body type
is Linotype Janson, based on the letters of Anton Janson,
a Dutch punchcutter who worked between 1660 and
1687.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Credo Books</span> is an important news series of biographies
that will appeal to both boys and girls. The subjects of
these biographies are Catholic, but their stories are not of
their faith so much as how that faith helped them to lead
remarkable lives. Past and present will be represented
here: a sculptor who left a priceless treasure of art to
mankind, or a movie star who was an idol to young and
old alike; the president of a South American country
who fought against and lost his life to Communist terrorists.
Heroes are made by the greatness of the human
spirit and all the figures to be portrayed in <span class="sc">Credo Books</span>
were great in spirit, courage and effort, no matter what
task they took upon themselves.</p>
<p>The authors of these new books have been carefully
chosen both for their ability to make biography come
alive for young people and their knowledge of their subjects.
Such authors as Gary Webster, Lon Tinkle, Donald
Demarest, Albert Orbaan, Terry Morris, Frank
Kolars and Jack Steffan will be represented.</p>
<p>To give <span class="sc">Credo Books</span> the benefit of their knowledge
and experience, an editorial board of distinguished representatives
from the fields of education, librarianship and
the Catholic press, as well as Hawthorn&rsquo;s own editorial
staff, choose both subject and author for each book in
the series.</p>
<p>As an example of the variety of personalities in this new
series, you will find the following figures portrayed.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
